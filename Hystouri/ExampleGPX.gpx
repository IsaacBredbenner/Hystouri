Lieutenant Bonnell completed this dangerous mission by successfully negotiating with Caddo Chief Cortes to have the warriors return to their villages and live in peace. Bonnell’s success greatly assisted Houston’s Army in prevailing at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. Captain Joseph Bonnell, who died on September 27, 1840, was the only active duty U.S. Army officer who was a Hero of the War for Texas Independence.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<center>Welcome to Wissahickon Valley Park and<br><b>Forbidden Drive</b></center>Many rough mill roads once ran through this valley. But as traffic increased, people needed a better road. In the early 1850s, work began on a turnpike to ease travel between the mills and the city.<br><br>In 1869 the turnpike became part of Fairmount Park. It became Upper Wissahickon Drive, free to all who came to enjoy the valley’s beauty.<br><br>With the coming of automobiles came years of debate: should the drive be a quiet park trail or busy road? In 1899 the park commission banned automobiles along the drive. But for nearly the next 30 years it received proposals to re-open the drive. The commission voted against them all and this stretch of road has been called &#8220;Forbidden Drive&#8221; ever since.<br><br><b> &#8220; . . . <i>Now the Wissahiccon is of so remarkable a loveliness that, were it flowing in England, it would be the theme of every bard, and the common topic of every tongue</i> . . . . &#8221;<br> &#8220;Morning on the Wissahiccon&#8221;<br>Edgar Allan Poe</b><br><br>In 1964 this park became one of the first seven places to be honored as a National Natural Landmark.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Strawberry Mansion Drive, Philadelphia, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Strawberry Mansion acquired its name in the mid-nineteenth century when it was a dairy and restaurant serving strawberries and cream. In its earlier days it had been property of Philadelphia judges. <p>
In 1783 Judge William Lewis, a Quaker, purchased this wooded land near the falls of the Schuylkill River. Remodeling an earlier structure, he completed the central portion of this house by 1790. While Philadelphia was still the capital of the United States he entertained his good fiends President George Washington and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton.<p>
&#8220;Summerville&#8221;, Lewis’s new house, reflected the balanced simplicity of early Federal architecture. The central entrance hall leads from the front door to the back gardens as in many of the older Georgian houses. The interior details are more delicate than those in nearby Woodford and Mount Pleasant.<p> 
Judge Joseph Hemphill bought Summerville in the 1820’s to enhance his social and political position. He added the flamboyant Greek revival wings to the house and entertained John C. Calhoun of South Carolina and the French Marquis de Lafayette. His son Coleman built a racetrack here, raised Dalmatian dogs, and grew strawberries from roots imported from Chile. When Hemphill invited Daniel Webster of Massachusetts to a political banquet to help unite northern and southern Democrats in support of Andrew Jackson, Webster simply toasted the strawberries and walked out the ballroom’s jib window.<p>
Hemphill later bought a partnership in Philadelphia’s Tucker China Factory, one of the first American makers of true porcelain. Today rare examples of Tucker porcelain are on display in the library. <p>
Strawberry Mansion became City property in 1868 and is the largest house in Fairmount Park. Furnished in a medley of styles popular during the mansion’s various ownerships, the house is maintained by the Committee of 1926 and the Fairmount Park Commission.

Inside the Llanerch Power Station, Wilbur Hall photographed workers waiting to shovel coal into the massive boilers powering the Hamilton Corliss steam engine [photo at top left]. Electricity generated here to run the trolleys also lighted many local homes and street lamps. In an ironic twist, the coal was delivered to the traction company by its rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad. Service to West Chester was provided until 1959. The buildings and water tower stood along West Chester Pike until 1972.<p>

Comfortable and reliable rail transportation to and from Philadelphia encouraged the development and growth of suburban neighborhoods in Haverford Township. The large sign behind the trolley car instructs perspective buyers of homes in Llanerch to visit the trolley station for information. Homes on Llandaff and Tenby can be seen in the distance.<p>
For a nickle, commuters traveled from Ardmore to 63rd Street in 22 minutes. The trolley ran along Darby Road stopping at Brookline, Oakmont, Merwood and Ardmore Junction on its way to Ardmore on the Main Line. The Ardmore Line operated until December 1966.<p>
The neighborhood of Llanerch, on land originally granted to Welsh Quaker, Lewis David grew from the farms of Silas Bewley, Morgan Davis, Mary Albertson and Charles Taylor. Mary Albertson is credited with naming Llanerch for a location in Wales.<p>
Many of Llanerch's beautiful homes were designed by the architectural firm of Kennedy, Hays and Kelsey. Both Robert G. Kennedy and Frank A. Hays maintained residences here. Mr. Hays planned the home of William C. Pritchett known as "Richland" across West Chester Pike where Gilmore and Olympic Roads are today. Llanerch was the first subdivision in the township to make use of deed restrictions, setbacks and minimum cost of the homes. By 1912 the community had two churches, an elementary school and a grocery store, now the Llanerch Fire House.<p>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On West Chester Pike (State Route 3) , Llanerch, (On the right when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The rail lines that met and crossed at Llanerch Junction in the 19th century transformed fields into suburban neighborhoods. In the 20th century, the corner where West Chester Pike and Darby Road meet was a gas station and car dealership, before lying fallow as a vacant, weed-choked lot. In 2007, transformed by the hard work of community volunteers and township Public Works employees, Llanerch Crossing became a proud gateway to Haverford Township.<p>
The history of transportation on West Chester Pike dates to the dusty, muddy stage coach days along the western extension of Market Street out of Philadelphia, known as the West Chester Road. The first improvement to this trail was the hemlock plank road of 1848. The wooden road, built by the Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Road Company, traveled from West Philadelphia to Newtown Square. Along the route penny-per-mile fees were collected at several toll houses. Fines also were imposed for avoiding the tollgate, speeding, vandalism or lying to the toll collector.<p>
In 1859 the Turnpike Road Company created a franchise company known as the Delaware County Passenger Rail Road with horse-drawn cars running on rails, bringing passengers on Sunday excursions from Philadelphia to Castle Rock, past Newtown Square. It was those open-air carriages which captivated the young John Shimer of Castle Rock. Shimer dreamed of one day owning a railroad. By 1891 Shimer had become a major stockholder in the Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Road Company and by 1895 his trolley line was in operation.<p>
Shimer's new company, The Philadelphia, Castle Rock and West Chester Railway, in partnership with The Delaware County Passenger Rail Road, would eventually grow to become the West Chester Traction Company. The mightiest obstacle for Shimer and his trolley line was the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, also building a passenger line called the Philadelphia & Delaware County Passenger Railroad, which would cross at Llanerch.<p>
Both rail companies were laying tracks to Newtown Square &#8212; Shimer along West Chester Pike and the PRR crossing West Chester Pike at Llanerch. This was a dangerous crossing, due to the blind nature of the angle of the Pennsy trains approaching the pike and the falling grade for trolleys traveling west. During July, 1895, in order to stop the trolley tracks, the PRR parked a locomotive in the direct path of the trolley rail line. The resulting Battle of Llanerch Crossing was fought in a labyrinth of legal contracts, injunctions, and appeals to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and at the junction itself with threats, fists and curses. Eleven railroad employees were arrested but no one was seriously injured. By the end of the summer of 1895, Shimer was victorious and a year later the trolleys were running on electricity just as planned.<p>

    <desc><![CDATA[A grieving father, John Jay Smith went to visit the grave of his daughter in Center City. He could not find it in the over-crowded churchyard and became determined to create a rural cemetery. Founded in 1836, Laurel Hill Cemetery was designed to be different from the start. It was to be a place located outside of the city, with a beautiful landscape and no religious affiliation. Laurel Hill was to be a peaceful place for the dead to rest and for the living to enjoy.

Laurel Hill's scenic site was established over 20 years before New York's Central Park. Picnics, horse-drawn carriage rides, walks and sightseers tours were popular activities during its early days. Today the 78 acre Cemetery is visited daily by historians, artists, researchers, dog-walkers, runners, cyclists, and sightseers.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Mill Creek gets its name from the active mill industry that flourished here from the 1790s to the 1870s. The mills adapted to suit a changing market place. During the early 1800s, a growing mill industry produced paper, grain, guns, and powder. In the 1850s, cotton yarn became the predominant product. The mill industry declined during the 1890s. Large automated factories were built along railroad lines and the smaller scale mills could no longer compete. In 1893 Mill Creek had a disastrous flood. The dams along the creek were destroyed and never rebuilt.<br><br>

<b><u><i>The Barker Mill</i></u></b><br>
The existing industrial buildings along Mill Creek adjacent to the park boundaries are known as the Barker Mill. It is the longest-lived mill on the creek. The parcel of land on which it is located was part of the original patent granted by William Penn to Robert Jones to establish the Welsh Barony in 1682. It is believed that Benjamin Brooke built the first mill around 1794 either to produce powder or manufacture armaments. From 1808 to 1861 the Nippes family operated a mill to manufacture rifles. During the War of 1812, they supplied rifles to the United States Government. In 1881 the mill was sold to William Booth. The cornerstone on the existing building reads <b>"Wm Booth Roseglen Mill 1886."</b> It produced carpet and rug yarn. The name Barker comes from Thomas A. Barker who bought the mill in 1923. He and his sons carded and spun wool there until the 1950s. In the 1970s the building was renovated for more modern uses: light industrial, offices, and artisan studio space.<br><br>

<b><i><u>The Ruins</b></i></u><br>
Visible along the floodplain of Mill Creek are large stone ruins that once housed mill workers. The mills themselves generally employed about 6-10 workers. The census of 1850 indicates predominant populations of laborers, mill workers, and local craftsmen in the Mill Creek area. Workers were housed on the property in tenements that could accommodate several families. There are two sets of major ruins along the floodplain of the park. This ruin was the three-story stone mill workers tenement pictured at left. Samuel Lehman Smith, a mill owner, constructed it between 1837 and 1840. Nearby is a root cellar.<br><br>

The other ruins, downstream closer to the Barker Mill, consisted of two buildings. One was a single unit that housed one family or several workers. The other was a double unit that housed two families. Both contained crafted stonework, heavy fireplace lintels, and attached kitchens. They date from the first quarter of the 19th century.<br><br>

<b>
The stone ruins are being stabilized through the efforts of the Township's Board of Commissioners. For your own safety and for the preservation of these cultural resources for future generations, please do not climb on them.

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Lock Street, Philadelphia, (On the left when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>Manayunk Canal</b><br>
The 1819 canal begins two miles upstream at Flat Rock Dam and ends here at Locks 69 and 70. It was part of a 108 mile system of canals, locks, dams, and slackwater pools built by the Schuylkill Navigation Company to transport goods and Schuylkill County anthracite coal. To move cargo, flat-bottomed boats were pulled by mule teams that walked a raised towpath located on the canal's river side. The canal also also provided water power that led to Manayunk's development as a nineteenth-century textile mill center.<br><br>

<b>Locks 69 & 70</b><br>
These locks were rebuilt following their initial, low-quality construction. Boats entered the double lock and were dropped or raised over 24 feet. Once below the locks, mules were carried on boats and poled across the Schuylkill River to continue their journey. Later, a wooden mule towpath bridge was built, and subsequently replaced, by a bridge cantilevered from the railroad bridge.<br><br>

<b>Decline of the Canal</b><br>
The Schuylkill Navigation Company operated successfully, staving off its chief competitor, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, until 1870. With funds depleted by a devastating drought followed a catastrophic flood, its system was leased to the railroad. The construction of the iron truss bridge, the Venice Island rail spur, and the track over the original towpath reflect the canal's obsolescence. The present towpath was actually established in the 1970s.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>First, McFadden's Mill</b><br>
In 1845, the Schofield family emigrated from England directly to Manayunk to work in the textile industry. After considerable success, Sevill Schofield left his father's cotton mill in 1857 to operate a new family endeavor: spinning carpet yarn in the McFadden Mill near the canal's lower locks.<br><br>

<b>Then the Economy Mills</b><br>
Although growth was steady, Sevill Schofield's Economy Mills business was further boosted by lucrative contracts to weave Union Army blankets for the Civil War. They were part of a "canyon" of four- and five-story mills that lined the canal from Lock Street north to Rector Street and covered Venice Island to the area of the Performing Arts Center. By 1885, the mill complex employed 850 men, women, boys, and girls who spun wool and cotton yarn, and wove cloth. Sevill Schofield's Economy Mills was one of the largest textile enterprises in Philadelphia.<br><br>

<b>Later, Imperial Woolen</b><br>
The Economy Mills expanded and thrived until the 1890s, when an economic slump caught Schofield by surprise. Thereafter, his brother-in-law, James Dobson, operated the mills as the Imperial Woolen Mills. They weathered the 1930s Great Depression but closed shortly after, leaving hundreds of workers without jobs. The buildings occupied by Richard Apex Inc., manufacturer of cleaners and lubricants for the metal industry, were purchased in 1957. The vacant buildings burned and were razed in the 1970s.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Venice Island is the legacy of 19th century industrial urbanization. In 1819 a three mile flyer of schist was sliced away from Manayunk by a narrow canal that supplied textile mills on the Island. Today this site's location led the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) to install a subsurface combined Sewer Overflow Tank. This tank holds nearly 4 million gallons of a mixture of sewage and storm water during rain events preventing untreated wastewater flowing into the Schuylkill River.<br><br>

To enable the use of the island for this essential river protection project, PWD committed to a full scale reconstruction of the Venice Island's recreation facilities. PWD worked with its sister city agencies and the neighborhood in the master planning process. This site uses the best in sustainable storm water management, ecological design and restoration to provide a much-needed public place in the heart of Manayunk that addresses multiple needs - recreation, environmental protection, commerce and open space.<br><br>

The revitalized space reflects the Island's industrial heritage, local building techniques and the vibrant natural history along the Schuylkill River, all the while meeting the rigorous challenges of creating a safe city park in the floodway. This park resides at the intersection of nature and city, striving to bring both closer.]]></desc>

Around 1828, the McDowell Paper Mill began production of the lower canal section. Records are scant for McDowell's business. In the 1840-50s, Joseph McDowell produced paper in his four-story mill and leased space (a common practice at the time) to tenants who produced paper or spun cotton. In 1864, the property was sold to William H. Harding, owner and publisher of the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer,</i> to make paper for his various publications employing a relatively new process of using straw and wood, rather than rags, for the pulp.<br><br>

Connelly Paper, owners of the property from the 1960s to the late 1990s, produced two-ton craft paper rolls from recycled corrugated boxes that were transported across the river to its large Bala Cynwyd box factory. Although the original McDowell Mill stood along the canal until its demolition in 2013, the Paper Works on the upper canal section is still manufacturing paper.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>Discovery of Manayunk</b><br>
The village of Manayunk emerged from the quiet banks of the Schuylkill River, seven miles northwest of the port of Philadelphia, to produce textiles and other goods during the Industrial Revolution. By 1828, following completion of the Schuylkill Navigation Company's Flat Rock Dam and canal at Manayunk, ten mills crowded Venice Island to take advantage of the dam's water power. Five of the mills produced textiles and the others ground drugs and flour, rolled iron, cut nails, sawed wood, or made hats.<br><br>

<b>Miles of Mills</b><br>
With the advent of steam power, the need for the canal's power declined as mills expanded into Manayunk's hills. After the Civil War, the village teemed with four- and five-story textile and paper mills. Many women, children, and men worked long hours and suffered horrific working conditions that later improved through the creation of child labor laws and the use of labor strikes.<br><br>

Manayunk's mills continued to be significant in America's textile production until their closure brought on by the 1930s Great Depression. Buildings flanking the canal largely disappeared by 1970. Nevertheless, some of the remaining mills continue the village's industrial traditions and produce textiles, industrial lubricants, and paper.<br><br>

<i>[Caption:]</i><br>

The "S" Bridge, shown in this early 1900s photograph, was named for its shape. Built to carry train traffic over the Schuylkill river into Manayunk, it was replaced by the concrete arch bridge shown below. Note the mill buildings along the river.

    <desc><![CDATA[Established in 1869 as a non-profit, non-denominational cemetery, West Laurel Hill has long been a landmark of the Philadelphia region. Visiting beautifully landscaped cemeteries was a popular activity for Victorians. Designed as a civic institutions for public use, rural cemeteries provided a place for the general public to enjoy refined outdoor recreation amidst art and sculpture previously available only to the wealthy. Today, West Laurel Hill encompasses 187 acres, including 10 miles of paved roadway winding through gently rolling hills.<br><br>

It is also an arboretum and an outdoor sculpture garden rich in cultural and social history. The cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and remains an active cemetery and park. Many notable nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first century luminaries are interred at West Hill Cemetery, such as: Herman Haupt, civil engineer and Brigadier General of the Union Army; Dr. John Thompson Dorrance, inventor of condensed soup who eventually became sole owner of the Campbell Soup Company; Anna Marie Jarvis, founder of Mother's Day; John B. Stetsen, hatmaker; and Constantine Papadakis, President of Drexel University from 1995-2009.]]></desc>

Vine Creek generally ran parallel to the path of the railroad bed. Several creeks, including Vine Creek in Manayunk and West Manayunk, cut deep ravines into the landscape and emptied into the Schuylkill River. These creeks provided the power source for many textiles and paper mills. Vine Creek itself hosted four mills, including William Clegg's Cotton Mill, John Grindred Grist Mill, and Isaac Wetherill's Mill.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Before the advent of parks, the only great swaths of green open space where the general public could visit and picnic were cemeteries. For this reason, the West Laurel Hill Station (1884-1899) was one of the most popular of the early stops along the line and generated much weekend traffic. For city-dwellers seeking a rural setting, the railroad reinforced this effect by ornately landscaping the grounds around the station platforms.<br><br>

After passengers disembarked at the station platform, the trains would move another hundred feet down the rails to the freight platform, where caskets would be unloaded onto horse-drawn carriages. The brick-paved ramp carved into the hill that leads up to a side entrance of the cemetery still visible.<br><br>

The West Laurel Hill Station was decommissioned and disassembled in 1899 to make way for the new station at Barmouth, which was better located to service both West Laurel Hill Cemetery and the newly-incorporated Westminster Cemetery.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Clegg's Mill was located in Vine Creek's deep ravine to provide maximum water power. By 1851, three millponds were built to regulate the flow of the creek to turn the waterwheels that powered the mills. You are standing at the point on the map where Vine Creek and the rail line intersect.<br><br>

Building 2 of the mill housed a cotton picking machine. Fabric was weaved and finished in Building 1. Building 4 was where fabric was dyed. The friable nature of cotton manufacturing made it difficult to keep the mill clean, heightening the danger of fire. In the case of Clegg's Mill, fire protection was provided by twelve iron, fire-proof buckets and two fire extinguishers. According to the 1888 Hexamer survey shown here, Clegg's Mill employed 36 hands &#8212; 8 men, 10 boys and 18 girls.<br><br>

Sometime between 1913 and 1917 the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired and closed Clegg's Mill, filled in the ponds and virtually buried Vine Creek under tons of rubble.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Conshohocken State Road (State Route 23) , Bala Cynwyd, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Philadelphia & Columbia Railroad was one of America's first railways. By the late 1820s, Philadelphia, the second largest city in the nation, lacked access to western markets. New York had the Erie Canal and Baltimore would soon have the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.<br><br>

Philadelphia business interests induced the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to fund the ambitious Main Line of Public Works, a railroad and canal system from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Travel between these two cities was reduced from three weeks by wagon to three and a half days by railroad and canal. The first portion of the Main Line was the railroad between Philadelphia and Columbia, a small community on the Susquehanna River. Initially contractors paid tolls to move horse-drawn trains over the railroad. The company soon evolved into a more conventional railroad that ran its own trains powered by steam locomotives.<br><br>

One striking engineering feature of the Philadelphia & Columbia was the Belmont Plane, approximately two miles east of here in Fairmount Park. Steam-powered cables hauled railroad cars up the steep grade of Belmont Hill. Although a marvel of engineering, the Philadelphia & Columbia quickly found that the plane created a bottleneck.<br><br>

As a pioneering railway, the Philadelphia & Columbia made use of early technology. It followed the example of the Baltimore & Ohio by using heavy, rectangular cut stone "sleeper" to anchor the iron rails. You can see a few examples of the stone blocks just to the right of this sign. The heavy stone ties kept the two parallel iron rails properly spaced. This literally kept the wheels of the early railroad cars on track. Over time the early railroads switched to wooden ties on a bed of gravel.<br><br>

In 1835, the West Philadelphia Railroad was chartered to the bypass the slow moving plane. Due to financial difficulties, this route was not completed until 1850, at which time most of the original alignment of the Philadelphia & Columbia between Ardmore and Philadelphia was abandoned.<br><br>

Philadelphians agitated for an all rail route to Pittsburgh and the first step in achieving this goal was the incorporation of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1846 to operate a railway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. In 1857 the Pennsylvania Canal Commission sold the Philadelphia & Columbia Railroad to the Pennsylvania Railroad.<br><br>

The Pennsylvania Railroad, headquartered in Philadelphia, would go on to become one of America's wealthiest and most important railroads from the late-nineteenth century until 1968.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[In the mid-1800s, the valley was changing from an industrial center to a recreational area. A new turnpike gave people easy access to the valley's beauty. The Valley Green Hotel, built in 1850, gave them a place to eat, drink and rest.<br><br>

The hotel hosted dances, sleigh parties and countless visitors. But time took its toll and the hotel went through several renovations.<br><br>

The most significant took place in 1899 when the Colonial Dames restored the rundown building and added new elements like leaded glass windows. The building then became known as the Valley Green Inn.<br><br>

Other inns have come and gone along the Wissahickon. Now only Valley Green, one of the most beloved places in the park, is still in operation.<Br><br>

<b><i>The long, low building near the inn is a warming shed. Guests could keep their horses stabled here to protect them during bad weather. The Friends of Wissahickon restored the shed in 1999. Keeping true to the original, they used old-fashioned joinery with wooden pegs instead of nails.</i></b>]]></desc>

The Spaventa Switchback refers to the section of the Cynwyd Heritage Trail running from the Manayunk Bridge to Rock Hill Road.<br><br>

The property was formerly owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) as a spur/switchback to serve the Pencoyd Iron Works. After the PRR went bankrupt in the 1970's the property was sold for commercial development.<br><br>

In 2008, Donato Spaventa sold the property to Lower Merion Township to extend the Cynwyd Heritage Trail to the intersection of Rock Hill Road and Belmont Avenue, thereby making an important connection between the trail and the Belmont Hills and College Park neighborhoods. This purchase was made using Montgomery County Open Space Funds.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
The original Pennsylvania Railroad bridge across the Schuylkill River, known as the "S" Bridge due to its shape, was constructed in 1884 as a double-track iron truss bridge that connected the West Manayunk community in Lower Merion to the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia. An "S" shape curve was incorporated into the design in order to produce drag, to help slow trains which invariably had built up momentum from descending the slope from Cynwyd Station. The bridge can be seen in the two early 20th century postcards at right and the 1908 map behind.<br><br>

Due to its heavier loads, which primarily consisted of freight trains carrying anthracite coal, the "S" Bridge was dismantled ca. 1918. It was replaced by the Manayunk Bridge (below), a Spanish-arch concrete bridge. This newer bridge is now fondly regarded by many as the definitive icon of Manayunk.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Pencoyd Iron Works was founded by Algernon and Percival Roberts, heirs of John Roberts, one of the first Welsh settlers of this region in 1683. John Roberts had named his land "Pencoyd," meaning "head of the woods" in Welsh.<br><br>

In 1852, the brothers began the construction of a specialty foundry, manufacturing railroad axles along the banks of the Schuylkill River. In 1859, the business expanded to include the manufacture of iron and steel bridges. It soon became a leading bridge producer, constructing hundreds of bridges across North America, including the Pencoyd Bridge, and the famous Upper Steel Arch Bridge across Niagara Falls.<br><br>

By 1883, its footprint encompassed 80 acres, including two miles of railroad tracks, and it produced products at a capacity of 35,000 tons per year. There were over 700 employees, many of whom lived nearby in company-owned workforce housing.<br><br>

By 1900, Pencoyd Iron Works had attained an international reputation, and the company was acquired by J.P. Morgan's U.S. Steel Corporation in 1902. However, the business was liquidated in 1944 after years of decline that began with the Great Depression.]]></desc>

In 1891, George Brooke Roberts, a Bala Cynwyd resident and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), ordered the construction of the Pencoyd Bridge off the Schuylkill Valley Division to the Pencoyd Iron Works. Up until that time, the iron works, owned the Percival Roberts, a cousin of the PRR president, had no choice but to use the services of the Reading Railroad, which passed by the factory as it ran along the river. The PRR branch was built solely to deliver coal and raw materials, and move out finished products for the Pencoyd Iron Works.<br><br>

This section of the trail was constructed on a portion of the land that was used for the switchback between the Manayunk Bridge and the trail's terminus at Rock Hill Road and Belmont Avenue. A chunk of the Switchback Bridge was found on the trail during a 2009 clean up &#8212; an unusual find since all of the salvaged metal was thought to have been sold for reuse.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>From Theodore W. Bean's <i>History of Montgomery County,</i> "Manufacturing Industries" (1884):<br>
<blockquote><i>
"These well known mills are situated on the Rockhill Creek [now Gully Run], close to the River road, and are better known by the name of Rudolph's Mills. In old times they were used for the making of dye-woods, and were known as Ashland Dye-Wood Mills. In 1860 they came into the hands of the present proprietor, A.S. Rudolph, who gradually increased the capacity of the mills until they have assumed their present proportions. Their specialty is newspaper material, of which they manufacture one hundred and eighty-five tons a month."
</i></blockquote><br>

Paper of every description was made here from straw, wood, recycled cotton rags, and waste paper. The mill supplied paper to Philadelphia's newspapers. The Superintendent and the hands lived in dwellings on the premises, known as Rudolph's Row. Remains of the mill and workers' housing were destroyed by the construction of the Schuylkill Expressway.]]></desc>
