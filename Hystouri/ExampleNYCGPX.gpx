    <desc><![CDATA[Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land; here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she with silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, your homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Broadway, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[One of America's earliest and greatest romantic skyscrapers, rising 60 stories above City Hall Park, the Woolworth Building held the coveted title of world's tallest building until losing it to the Chrysler Building in 1929. The Gothic inspired, terra-cotta clad skyscraper was built--and paid for in cash--by the inventor of that great American institution, the five-and-ten-cent store. When asked why he did it, Frank Woolworth said he wanted the building to advertise his stores--though there's also a story about competition with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which refused Woolworth a mortgage and then watched its own famous tower become the world's second tallest building.<br><br>

Wander in to what was once called the "Cathedral of Commerce" and you will find yourself in a vaulted arcade resplendent in marble walls, bronze Gothic filigree, and golden mosaics. Mimicking the nave and transept plan of church architecture, Woolworth's lobby rises to a gleaming mosaic ceiling. Voluptuous Gothic detail ranges from elaborately finished mailboxes to austere altar pieces of <i>Labor</i> and <i>Commerce</i> on the mezzanines. Sculpted caricatures by Tom Johnson show architect Cass Gilbert holding a model of the building, Woolworth paying for the building with his nickels and dimes, the builder, the steam engineer, and even Edward J. Hogan, the rental agent--but only because he protested in a letter to Gilbert that he was being left out.<br><br>

(Above) Set further back in the lobby is the Marble Hall, whose grand staircase rises to the former entrance of the Irving Trust Company. Secular rather than ecclesiastical in flavor, reminiscent of a flat-roofed medieval guild hall, it rises to a sumptuous glass ceiling inscribed with the names of history's great commercial cities.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near State Street, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This 1903 statue by Jonathan Scott Hartley (1845-1912) depicts the esteemed Swedish-American engineer and inventor John Ericsson (1803-1889), who helped to revolutionize military-maritime technology with his ironclad warship, the Monitor.<br><br>Ericsson was born in Langbanshyttan, Sweden to a mining proprietor father, observing and developing an interest in the operations of mining machinery as a child. Ericsson displayed an early talent for engineering, building a miniature sawmill before he was 11. His precocious ability caught the attention of the well-known engineer Count Platen, who appointed Ericsson a cadet in the corps of mechanical engineers at age 12. By age 14, he was placed in charge of 600 soldier operatives, while he himself made mechanical drawings for the canal project.<br><br>In 1836 Ericsson invented and patented the screw propeller, a device that vastly improved steam vessel travel. Approached by the United States Navy, Ericsson came to the United States in 1839, and designed a frigate, the Princeton, which united many of his technological inventions, including state-of-the-art screw propellers, smokestacks, ventilators, optical instruments, and gun carriages. However, a demonstration in 1844, in which a large gun accidentally exploded, killing the United States secretaries of the Navy and State, tarnished Ericsson’s reputation. Despite this setback, his engineering career revived in 1861 with the design and construction of the Monitor iron-clad war ship.<br><br>The Monitor was Ericsson’s response to the Confederacy’s intent in early 1861 to ironclad its warship, the Merrimac. Ericsson built the Monitor at the Continental Iron Works foundry in Greenpoint, Brooklyn; its engine and machinery were fabricated in Greenwich Village at the Delamater Iron Works. The keel was laid on October 15, 1861, and within an astounding 100 days, the Monitor was launched. Ericsson’s newfangled ship was put to the test in a famous battle against the Merrimac off of Hampton Roads, Virginia on March 9, 1862, where the Union forces averted defeat. He dedicated his later years to diverse scientific investigations, including experiments with solar power and its practical applications. For his efforts he had many honors bestowed upon him in the United States, Sweden, and other European nations. He died on March 8, 1889, in New York City.<br><br>Less than four years after his death, the distinguished sculptor Jonathan Scott Hartley was commissioned by the state to create a larger-than-life bronze portrait of Ericsson, which was dedicated April 26, 1893 in Battery Park. The pedestal was designed by architect Frank Wallis; Hartley and Wallis also collaborated on the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Memorial, unveiled in Van Cortlandt Park in 1906. Ten years later the sculptor, dissatisfied with his first version, crafted a modified statue, cast at the local Roman Bronze Works, and dedicated on August 1, 1903, a day after the centennial of Ericsson’s birth. In 1939 a monument to Ericsson and the Monitor was unveiled in McGolrick Park, Brooklyn.<br><br>The sculpture in Battery Park depicts the bearded Ericsson holding a boat model in his hand. The pedestal features inset bronze bas-reliefs, which illustrate significant naval battles involving the Monitor and Princeton, as well as an array of Ericsson’s mechanical inventions. Over time the monument suffered extensive damage, the result of weathering, vandalism, and even a fire. In 1996 the sculpture was conserved by Parks’ monuments crew, and as part of overall improvements to Battery Park, the sculpture is slated to be moved from its present location to a more prominent site near a perimeter entrance.]]></desc>

Designed by Dutch sculptor H.A. van den Eijnde (1869-1939), the monument was dedicated in 1926 to mark the tercentenary of Dutch occupation, and the purchase of the island of Manhattan from Native Americans. On the north and south faces of the granite pedestal are carved a plan of New Amsterdam and its fort, as well as the transaction between the Dutch and the Lenape natives, and above them are bronze emblems symbolizing Dutch settlement. The flagstaff was unveiled on Saint Nicholas Day, December 6, 1926 south of Castle Clinton, then the site of the New York Aquarium. When the park was closed from 1940 to 1952 for renovations and to build the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the monument was relocated to its present site at the northeast entrance.<br>The maintenance of this monument by the Citywide Monuments Conservation Program is made possible by the generous support of The History Channel, with additional support from the Netherland &#8211; American Foundation, the Samuel H.

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 5th Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This monument honors the legendary 369th Infantry Regiment known as the Harlem Hellfighters. The black granite obelisk is a replica of a 1997 memorial that stands in Sechault in Northern France, where the 369th soldiers distinguished themselves in World War I. Unveiled on September 29, 2006, the 88th anniversary of that battle, the obelisk is 12 feet high and features gilded inscriptions, the 369th's crest and its coiled rattlesnake insignia.<br><br>
During World War I, United States Armed Forces remained segregated by race. In 1913 New York established the 15th New York (Colored) Infantry Regiment, a unit of the National Guard. The U.S. Army mustered the unit into Federal service in 1917, and the 369th (Colored) Infantry Regiment went to France that December, among the first 100,000 troops of the American Expeditionary Force.<br><br>
Exhibiting extraordinary valor, the 369th, an integral part of the Fourth French Army, fought on the front until the Armistice. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive the 369th showed exceptional bravery, especially on September 29, 1918, during the liberation of Sechault, when a third of the regiment suffered casualties.<br><br>
Cited for their heroism, 171 members of the regiment were decorated with the Croix de Guerre (Cross of War) and one officer [1st Lt. George Seanor Robb of Kansas] received the Medal of Honor. Upon their return to the United States, the Harlem Hellfighters were honored by the City with a parade up Fifth Avenue. During World War II, the 369th distinguished itself at Okinawa, and later fought in the Korean and Gulf Wars. The unit serves today as a sustainment brigade.<br><br>
The 369th Historical Society and the 369th Veterans Association were supported by numerous associated organizations in the commission of this monument. The U.S. Army moved the monument from its fabricator in France to an airfield in Germany, and the New York Air National Guard then brought it to New York. With support from the City Council, Parks and Recreation redesigned and landscaped this triangle to feature the monument.<br><br>
Across the street stands the 369th Armory, one of the last armories erected in New York City. It was built between 1921 and 1933 and combines both medieval and art deco influences. The building is still home to the 369th Sustainment Brigade, as well as historical exhibits, and a recreation center.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Daniel Butterfield (1831-1901) was born October 31, 1831. His father John was a leader in the express mail business, and helped found the American Express Company. Butterfield graduated from Union College in 1849, and became a merchant in New York City. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he served as a colonel in the 12th New York militia. Demonstrating leadership in military engagements on the upper Potomac in the Shenandoah Valley, Butterfield rose rapidly in the ranks to brigadier-general of volunteers in the 12th Infantry.<br><br>Butterfield distinguished himself as an officer, and during the Chancellorsville and Gettysburg campaigns he served as chief of staff to the Army of the Potomac. Wounded at Gettysburg, he was reassigned as General Hooker’s chief of staff at Chattanooga and the Atlanta campaign. By the war’s end, Butterfield was promoted to a major general &#8220;for gallant and meritorious conduct.&#8221; Among all his wartime achievements, he is best remembered as the composer of the mournful bugle call &#8220;Taps.&#8221;<br><br>After the war, Butterfield remained in the Army in New York City, where he was superintendent of the recruiting service and commander of the troops in New York harbor. He resigned in March 1870 and headed the local United States sub-treasury before joining the family business, American Express. Butterfield also displayed considerable business acumen in real estate and railroad construction ventures. In 1886, he married Julia Lorrilard James in London, England.<br><br>In his later years, Butterfield was the master of ceremonies for several notable events and public spectacles including the Washington Centennial Celebration (1889), General Sherman’s funeral (1891), and Admiral Dewey’s triumphant return from Manila (1899). He is entombed at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.<br><br>This bronze statue of the general was created by the famous sculptor John Gutzon Borglum (1867-1941), better known for his sculptures of four U.S. Presidents on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. The firm of Ludlow and Peabody designed the granite base. In her will, Julia Butterfield specifically directed the executors to &#8220;cause to be made and erected in the Borough of Manhattan, near or in Central Park, a colossal statue of General Daniel Butterfield, representing him standing with his arms folded and wearing a cocked hat, as shown in a picture of him in bronze bas relief in the rooms of the Historical Society at Utica, New York.&#8221;<br><br>The sculptor Borglum was born in Idaho, the son of Danish immigrants. One of several brothers who became sculptors, he studied in France before settling in New York City in 1902. He maintained a sculpture studio at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine at Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street. In accordance with Mrs. Butterfield’s will, Borglum depicted the General in heroic size, in full-dress uniform, head held high, with arms folded. The general stands on a stylized rock intended to evoke the rocky terrain of Little Round Top at Gettysburg.<br><br>The statue was cast by the Gorgham Bronze Foundry in 1917, and erected on February 23, 1918, in the southeast corner of Sakura Park, west of Grant’s Tomb. Disputes between the sculptor and the executors caused the artist to sue for claims of $32,000. He was asked to modify his design so extensively that he signed the piece on the top of the head, commenting wryly, &#8220;<i>That this is the only part of the original statue they didn’t make me change.</i>&#8221;<br><br>In 1936, the statue was restored and a replacement sword was attached. In 1986, adjoining granite benches were removed and the balustrade modified as part of the overall reconstruction of Sakura Park. In 1999, the City Parks Foundation Monuments Conservation Program restored the monument with funding from the American Express Company, the Florence Gould Foundation, and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.]]></desc>

Morris, the nephew of a successful English architect, was greatly influenced by the designs of the 16th-century Itallian architect Palladio. This sophisticated residence includes a monumental portico and pediment, supported by grand Tuscan columns, and a large, two-story octagonal addition in the rear, one of the first of its kind in the country.<br><br>Before Harlem Heights developed into the vibrant community it is today, this site commanded views of lower Manhattan as well as New Jersey and Westchester. With the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, Morris, a Loyalist, left for England. His home, which he called &#8220;Mount Morris,&#8221; was then occupied successively by George Washington, British Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, and the Hessian commander Baron Wilhelm von Knyphausen. Washington’s use of this house as his temporary headquarters between September 14 and October 20, 1776, is well documented by his daily correspondence and official papers.<br><br>After the war, the Morris’s property was confiscated and sold by the new American government. It became Calumet Hall, a popular tavern along the Albany Post Road. In 1810 Stephen and Eliza Jumel bought the property. Madame Jumel was from an impoverished Rhode Island family. Her marriage to Stephen Jumel, a wealthy French merchant who had made his fortune in the wine trade, gave her entry to New York’s highest social circles. The Jumels spent several years in France, where they made friends in the elite circle around Napoleon’s court. They returned to the United States in 1828 to settle in the mansion. Inspired by cutting-edge French fashion, Madame Jumel bought new furniture and redecorated her home in the elegant Empire style.<br><br>One year after her husband’s death in 1832 from injuries sustained in a carriage accident, Madame Jumel married former Vice President Aaron Burr in the mansion’s front parlor. The marriage was not a success, and the couple formally divorced in 1836. The immensely wealthy Madame Jumel became increasingly eccentric as time passed and lived in the mansion until her death in 1865. The City bought the house from later owners, the Earles, in 1903. With the assistance of the Daughters of the American Revolution, it opened as a public museum the next year.<br><br>Today, Morris-Jumel Mansion and Roger Morris Park are part of the Jumel Terrace Historic District. The house features nine restored, period rooms including George Washington’s office, a dining room glittering with 19th century ceramics and glass, and Eliza Jumel’s chamber with a bed that she maintained belonged to Napoleon. The third floor houses an archive and reference library. Morris-Jumel Mansion is owned by Parks & Recreation, is a member of the Historic Trust of New York City, and operated by Morris-Jumel Mansion, Inc.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>India House</b><br>The handsome brownstone building facing Hanover Square, built in 1853, originally housed the Hanover Bank &#8211; making this a rare surviving bank building from pre-Civil War New York. Like so many banks, it was inspired by Italian Renaissance palaces &#8211; appropriately enough, since many such palaces had themselves been built for powerful Italian banking families. The building’s varied history includes service as New York’s Cotton Exchange and the offices of W.R. Grace and Company. Since 1914, it has been home to India House, a private club founded by shipping executive James A. Farrell and newspaperman Willard Straight. The club’s early members &#8211; businessmen engaged in foreign trade &#8211; chose the name &#8220;India House&#8221; to suggest the romance of exotic ports.<br><br><b>Hanover Square</b><br>Hanover Square’s history as a public space dates back to the first years of the Dutch settlement. Named later for the British monarchy &#8211; the Hanoverians being the family of King George the Third, as well as the ancestors of the current Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles &#8211; Hanover Square is one of the very few such royal place names in New York not dropped after the Revolution.<br><br><b>British Memorial Garden</b><br>Hanover Square has been transformed into the British Memorial Garden, a gift from the British community and its American friends to the people of New York City. The garden, designed by British landscape architects Julian and Isabel Bannerman, overflows with symbols, materials and plantings typical of the United Kingdom &#8211; from Scottish stone and Welsh slate, to City of London bollards, to an outline map of the British counties. Yew trees trimmed into abstract patterns offer a contemporary take on the traditional British topiary. The garden honors the memory of 67 British victims of the World Trade Center attacks, while also offering a place for the British community to gather for special events. British artist Anish Kapoor’s black granite sculpture Unity &#8211; symbolizing the unity between the United States and the United Kingdom &#8211; includes a light-reflecting chamber suggesting an eternal flame.]]></desc>

These range from the surprisingly old-3,000-year-old pottery shards-to the rather new-1950s lunch counter artifacts. In between sit the castoffs of three centuries of city dwellers: Delft tiles and clay pipes from the Dutch, tenement medicine bottles from 19th-century immigrants, and children’s dolls from the early 20th-century African-American community of Weeksville in Brooklyn.<br><br>Exhibits on the museum’s lower levels graphically depict the potential finds, layer by layer, beneath a typical Wall Street building. The &#8220;Unearthing New York Systems Elevator&#8221; simulates a ride from street level down to the lowest levels of a typical &#8220;dig.&#8221; And visitors can watch archaeologists work behind glass walls, cataloguing and conserving real finds.<br><br><b>The Shrine of Elizabeth Ann Seton</b><br>New York is a city of straight lines &#8211; it’s the very rare building that curves. The rectory of the Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton occupies one of them: the elegant house built in 1793 for one James Watson, with an 1806 addition whose portico curves along State Street.<br><br>At the time, the entire area was a posh residential district lined with fine brick town houses; today the Watson House is the sole survivor, one of the few Downtown buildings that survived the Great Fire of 1835. The double-story wooden columns of the extension’s upper floors are said to be made from old shipmasts.]]></desc>

Embury’s group outgrew temporary quarters in a rigging loft, and in 1768 the preacher, by trade a carpenter, built the first &#8220;preaching house,&#8221; the Wesley Chapel on John Street. Though the Methodists in Embury’s time still belonged to the Anglican Church, the American Revolution quickly led to a break between the American Methodists and the Church, followed by the creation of a new Methodist Episcopal denomination and the transformation of Wesley Chapel from preaching house to church. The current John Street Church, third on the site, incorporates timbers and stones from Wesley Chapel.]]></desc>

The Society was organized in New York in 1766 by Philip Embury, and ardent Irish Methodist and former Wesleyan preacher who settled here in the seventeen-sixties.<br><br>The society rented the upper story of &#8220;The Old Rigging Loft&#8221; in 1767, a space sometimes used for rigging sails, located on the eastern side of William Street between John and Fulton streets. Embry was joined in his preaching by Thomas Webb, a retired British captain who was given license as a lay preacher by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism.<br><br>In 1768 the society built a chapel which Embury designed. The first sexton was Peter Williams, a former slave who won emancipation and helped found the A.M.E. Zion Church.<br><br>A larger church was built on this site in 1818 and the stones of Embury’s original chapel were laid in the foundation. The second church was demolished in 1840 to accommodate the widening of John Street. The present structure was designed by William Hurry in the Federal style. Its foundations still hold the stones of Embury’s chapel and some of its structural elements were made of the stout, handhewn beams of the 1817 building.<br><br>Called &#8220;Old John Street,&#8221; the building is notable for the handsome Palladian window directly above the broad main entrance door, and the simple dignity of the interior.<br><br>John Street is also the site of an early incident of bloodshed in the Revolutionary period. In 1770 the patriotic Sons of Liberty attacked three of the king’s soldiers found posting insulting placards. This culminated in the Battle of Golden Hill (an early name for John Street east of William), in which citizens and soldiers clashed briefly. This event occurred several years before the celebrated Boston Massacre.<br><br>The John Street Theater, one of the city’s first, was opened in 1767 just east of Broadway. A contemporary described it as &#8220;principally of wood, an unsightly object, painted red.&#8221; General Howe’s British occupation forces took part in its productions, and Washington attended performances there when New York was the federal capital.

    <desc><![CDATA[In spring 2006, during the South Ferry excavation in the Battery, four sections of a colonial era wall were identified by archeologists. Although each of the four sections exhibited unique features, they are all likely part of the same wall, constructed between 1730 and 1766. Differences among the sections may be due to successive periods of construction, which would account for the various building materials and construction techniques used. Sections 1 and 2 were built directly on bedrock and made of mortared sandstone. Sections 3 and 4 were dry-laid shift, with section 3 built upon a cobble foundation and section 4 standing on a sand foundation.<br><br>The section pictured below [on the marker] is associated with a large log feature, which may have been a portion of a pier. It was documented in detailed drawings, and samples of the wood were taken for dating. Because of the archaeological analysis, the wall was determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Ongoing study of this important discovery will provide a more detailed history of the Battery than has ever been possible before.<br><br><b>The portion of the wall temporarily displayed here in Castle Clinton National Monument is from section 1, the first to be unearthed on November 8, 2005.

    <desc><![CDATA[In 1790 the Common Council of the City of New York authorized the removal of stone and soil from Fort George and the Grand Battery to fill in the pier line along the Battery. Beginning in 1808, the defenses of the city were extended out into the harbor through the construction of new forts on Bedloes (Liberty) Island, Ellis Island, Governor’s Island, and on an island just 200 feet off the tip of Manhattan, known as the South-West Battery. Together, these forts with their heavy armament discouraged the British from attacking New York City during the War of 1812. The South-West Battery was renamed Castle Clinton in honor of Mayor DeWitt Clinton, becoming the headquarters of the Third Military District.<br><br>While its military importance declined, Castle Clinton’s value as a delightful location for recreation on the harbor increased. In 1824 it was leased by the City of New York as a place of public entertainment and renamed Castle Garden. Within a month of its opening, the Marquis de Lafayette landed here at the start of his triumphal tour of America. Presidential visits by Andrew Jackson, James Polk and Milliard Fillmore followed. The public was entertained and informed by a balloon ascension, F.B. Morse’s telegraph demonstration, and concerts such as Jenny Lind’s American debut.<br><br>In 1855, Castle Garden was leased by the State of New York to serve as the first immigrant landing depot in the United States. As the flow of immigrants became a flood following the political unrest in Europe of the 1840s and the famine in Ireland, New York took responsibility for providing immigrants with essential services such as health care, employment and transportation. More than eight million people had entered through Castle Garden by the time of its closure in 1890. The Federal government assumed responsibility for immigration control soon after, and a larger immigrant receiving facility was built on Ellis Island. Go to CastleGarden.org to see if your ancestors were among these early immigrants.<br><br>The growing demand for public education facilities and programs led to the next adaptation of Castle Clinton. The building was altered once again and re-opened in 1896 as the New York City Aquarium. Millions of visitors enjoyed seeing aquatic creatures from local waters and around the world. The Aquarium was closed in 1941 in order to make way for a new Brooklyn-Battery subway tunnel.<br><br>It was through the demolition of the Aquarium that the original walls of Castle Garden were revealed to the public. A determined group of preservationists accepted the challenges of preventing its complete destruction, leading to the designation of Castle Clinton as a National Monument following World War II.<br><br>In a similar fashion, it is the same current subway excavation that has unearthed the Battery walls and claimed for them a place on the National Register of Historic Places. It is through this ever-present need for improved transportation and safety that we have been reconnected with our past and have recognized the great the great historical importance of our surrounding walls.]]></desc>

In July 1968 the Seaman's' Church Institute moved to its present quarters at 15 State Street.

    <desc><![CDATA[On February 4, 1846, the ship Brooklyn sailed from Manhattan's Old Slip. Chartered by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the ship carried men, women, and children to California as part of the epic movement of Mormons to the West. By coincidence, on the same day, the Mormons began their famous migration by crossing the Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois, on their way across the Great Plains to the Salt Lake Valley. <br><br>

The chartered ship, captained by Abel W. Richardson, was 125 feet long, was rated at 445 tons, and carried 234 passengers. The Brooklyn stopped at Juan Fernandez Island and Honolulu before reaching Yerba Buena, later named San Francisco, on July 31, 1846. Eleven passenger deaths and two births marked the six-month passage. The more than 20,000-mile voyage is the longest recorded religious exodus in history. <br><br>

When the ship left New York City, California belonged to Mexico. By the time the ship arrived, the United States had claimed California as a result of the Mexican-American War. Led by Samuel Brannan, the Mormons of the ship Brooklyn were among the first United States citizens to settle in California prior to the gold rush.]]></desc>

It was the heartbeat of Harlem’s community and a testament to the indomitable spirit of and creative impulse of African-Americans. It was a catalyst for inspiration where dancers and musicians blended influences to forge new, wide-spread, and long-lasting traditions in music and dance.<br><br>

In World War II, 1,100 Norwegian ships served the Allied cause by hauling supplies between U.S. ports and the war theaters abroad. A sizeable part of the Allied forces were supplied by ships flying the Norwegian flag. More than 30,000 sailors and naval gunners manned the ships. Many of them looked to New York, the principal port of call, as their home port during the war. The losses were heavy, 570 ships and 4,000 sailors. <br><br>

Additional works were added throughout the early to mid-18th century.<br><br>The final and strongest outwork is thought to have been constructed in 1766 or 1767. Called the &#8220;Grand Battery&#8221;, it was built of stone and accommodated one hundred cannon. It was from this battery that Alexander Hamilton and Captain John Lamb removed eleven artillery pieces at the beginning of the American Revolution in 1775.<br><br>The Grand Battery was the target of naval gunfire from the British warships HMS Phoenix and HMS Rose as they sailed up the Hudson River on July 12, 1776. Following the seizure of New York in September, 1776, Fort George and the Battery again became the headquarters of the British Army in New York. In 1790, following the American Revolution, the City of New York demolished Fort George and leveled the Grand Battery to use the materials to fill in the pier line along the shore.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<center>The Falconer Statue<br>
Central Park</center>
This elegant bronze statue by British Sculptor George Blackall Simonds (1843-1929) depicts a young falconer in Elizabethan garb holding aloft a falcon poised for release. <br><br>
<i>The Falconer</i> is representative of the rich sculptural collection Central Park inherited in the 19th century. The original Falconer was created for Trieste, Italy, and shown in 1875 at the Royal Academy in London, England. It appears that George Kemp (1826-1893), a wealthy, Irish-born, New York merchant admired the sculpture so much that he commissioned a full-scale replica for Central Park. It was dedicated on May 31, 1875 on a cylindrical granite pedestal, perched on a natural rock outcropping, south of the 72nd Street transverse road, and east of the park's West Drive. <br><br>
Born in Reading, England, to a prosperous family of brewers, Simonds attended Saint Andrew's College (later Bradfield College). Demonstrating early promise as a sculptor, he studied art in Dresden, Germany and Brussels, Belgium. Then for 12 years he resided in Rome, Italy. Simonds himself was an avid falconer, and in an official portrait made of him as chairman of the family brewery, Sir Oswald Brimley depicted him with a falcon. <br><br>
Simond's other work includes a monumental lion sculpture he created in 1886 for the Forbury Gardens in Reading, England, which commemorates British veterans of the Afgan War of 1880. His depiction of Queen Victoria, created for her golden jubilee of 1887, stands outside Reading Town Hall. Another casting of <i>The Falconer</i> that stands in Lynch Park in Beverly, Massachusetts, is a gift reportedly of Robert Evans, a native of Beverly, who had admired the sculpture while convalescing at a New York hospital near Central Park. <br><br>
<i>The Falconer</i> has had a checkered history, having suffered extensive damage from weathering and vandals. Indanger of toppling, then monument was shored up by the Parks Department in 1937. A new falcon was fashioned and attached in 1957, but further vandalism forced the City to move the sculpture to storage for safekeeping. In 1982, the entire arm and falcon were replaced , and the statue was reinstalled. <i>The Falconer</i> was conserved and repatined in 1995 by the Central Park Conservancy, as part of its mission to restore and preserve the park for present and future generations. <br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<center>Tecumseh Playground<br>
.738 acre</center>
One of the Civil War’s best-known generals, William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891) was born in Lancaster, Ohio in 1820. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1840 and served in California and the Mexican War. Appointed brigadier general of volunteers in 1861, Sherman fought at Bull Run and Shiloh. Promoted to major general in 1862, he distinguished himself in the Vicksburg and Chattanooga campaigns of 1863. Sherman blazed a trail of destruction as his troops seized Atlanta, marched to the sea, and headed north through the Carolinas. He received the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston on April 26, 1865, seventeen days after the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia. <br><br>
General Sherman retired to New York and resided near what is now called Sherman Square on W. 70th Street and Broadway. He died in New York in 1884. The saying &#8220;War is hell&#8221; is attributed to Sherman. His younger brother, Senator John Sherman (1823-1900) of Ohio, was the author of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. <br><br>
In 1952 the City of New York acquired additional property on the block bounded by Amsterdam Avenue, West 78th Street, Columbus, and West 77th Street for school and recreational purposes. The old P.S. 87 building on the site was razed, and the new William T. Sherman School opened in 1954. Plans were drawn up for a playground for school and community use, to be jointly operated by Parks and the Board of Education. The design incorporated play equipment and facilities for rollerskating and basketball, and maintained the old school garden. <br><br>
The site was updated as an adventure playground by architect M. Paul Friedberg by 1970. When that arrangement became obsolete, Operation Playground, a 1500-member neighborhood organization of parents and children, was established to raise funds, design, and construct new facilities for the site. The group raised $55,000 in private contributions, and Parks added more than $30,000. Nationally known playground architect Robert Leathers designed the facility with a maze, fire engine, tire bridge and swing, treehouse, roller coaster obstacle bridge, and suspension bridge with tunnels. Over the course of seven days in May 1987, community volunteers and Parks laborers worked side by side to build &#8220;Wood Park.&#8221; A short segment about the playground construction runs periodically on the beloved children’s television show &#8220;Sesame Street.&#8221;<br><br>
In 1997 Council Member Ronnie Eldridge funded, for $760,000, the fourth incarnation of Tecumseh Playground. The new design allows children to imagine a journey between New York City and the West in the 1870s. The entrance is marked by a train silhouette on the fence and colored pavement train tracks which lead into the playground. On the &#8220;east&#8221; side of the playground, playhouses and tot play equipment represent cosmopolitan shops and the Grand Central Depot. On the &#8220;west&#8221; side, a Conestoga wagon climber, buffalo play sculptures, spray shower, and fortress play equipment suggest the thrill of the frontier. In the center a decorative paved area depicts leaf shapes and animal footprints from the eastern and western United States. Other features include new safety surfacing, drinking fountain, drainage and water supply. A new weathervane signals the cavalry charge of school children from P.S. 87 scrambling into Tecumseh Playground to have some fun. <br><br>

In 2005, renowned sculptor Steve Tobin worked with tree experts to preserve the original Sycamore stump that you see here at St. Paul's.<br><br>

Tobin also created a monumental bronze memorial sculpture based on castings of the tree's roots. Called the "Trinity Root" in honor our mother church, it can be seen in the plaza of Trinity Church, located five blocks south at Broadway & Wall Street.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[The Amiable Child Monument]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Riverside Drive, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This unique New York City monument marks the site of one of the few private graves on public land within the five boroughs. It belongs to St. Claire Pollock (the namesake of nearby St. Clair Place), a child who died on July 15, 1797 in the fifth year of his life, probably from a fall from the cliffs of the parkland onto the rocks near the Hudson River.
<br><br>
In the two centuries that have passed since the tragedy of the "Amiable Child"--as he was described on his headstone--different accounts of St. Claire’s origins and family have persisted. George Pollock, the owner of the property on which the boy was buried, was either his father or his uncle. He was a linen merchant of Scots-Irish, or possibly English descent, who lived in a mansion on Strawberry Hill (later called Claremont) in the 1790s. He had sold his property to Mrs. Cornelia Verplanck, his former neighbor, by January 18, 1800 when he wrote as follows:
<br><br>
"There is a small enclosure near your boundary fence within which lie the remains of a favorite child, covered by a marble monument. You will confer a peculiar and interesting favor upon me by allowing me to convey the enclosure to you so that you will consider it a part of your own estate, keeping it, however, always enclosed and sacred."
<br><br>
Claremont Hill was the site of the Battle of Harlem Heights, fought during the Revolutionary War, on September 16, 1776. By 1806 it had been acquired by Michael Hogan, a former British Consul in Havana, who built Claremont Mansion (for which Claremont Avenue was named). Possible sources for the name are Hogan’s birthplace of County Clare, Ireland and his friend Prince William, Duke of Clarence, who would ascend the English throne as King William IV in 1830. Known as the site of a popular roadside inn by 1860, Claremont was acquired by the City from the heirs of Joel Post in 1873, for the development of Riverside Park.
<br><br>
In the 1890s Claremont Inn was host to numerous politicians, socialites and entertainers including the Morgans, Vanderbilts and Whitneys, Lillian Russell, and Admiral George Dewey. By 1907 the Inn had been transformed into a restaurant, serving the likes of Cole Porter and James J. Walker. It was destroyed by fire in 1950. The playground which now stands on the site was built shortly afterwards.
<br><br>
A century after the Tomb of the Amiable Child was laid, New York’s most famous monumental grave--Grant’s Tomb--was completed. The domed structure across Riverside Drive, designed by architect John Duncan and sculptor John Massey Rhind, was dedicated on April 27, 1897. The latter structure is as grand a testimony to the accomplishments of national leader as the monument to the amiable child is a modest and touching tribute to a young boy who never had the opportunity to grow into adulthood.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Battery Place, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This monument in Battery Park north of Castle Clinton, honors military personnel who served in the Korean Conflict (1950-1953). The memorial, dedicated in 1991, was designed by Welsh-born artist Mac Adams (b. 1943) and is notable as one of the first Korean War memorials erected in the United States.<br><br>

The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel, the dividing line between North and South Korea, and invaded South Korea. Within a month, the North Koreans had pushed the South Korean army and supporting U.S. forces to the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula. In response, the United Nations authorized an army under the command of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964), to repulse the North Koreans and re-establish the boundary between the North and South at the 38th parallel. In mid-September, MacArthur staged a daring amphibious landing at the Inchon Peninsula and attacked the North Koreans from behind. The U.N. troops had soon pushed the North Korean army back across the 38th parallel, and were advancing on the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China.<br><br>

Fearing invasion, Chinese forces next became involved in the conflict. In November, the Chinese attacked the U.N. forces near the Yalu River, and quickly succeeded in driving them back into South Korea. The U.N. forces then counterattacked and managed to re-establish a battle line near the 38th parallel. In April 1951, President Harry S. Truman (1884-1972) relieved General MacArthur of his command, rejecting MacArthur's aggressive policies which Truman believed would instigate a major war with China and the Soviet Union. Fighting would continue in Korea for the next two years, although little ground was ultimately exchanged. Finally, on July 27, 1953, both sides signed an armistice, which ended hostilities and restored the 38th parallel as the dividing line between North and South Korea.<br><br>

In 1987 the Korean War Veterans Memorial Committee was formed to raise money to build a monument to commemorate the soldiers of the "forgotten war". Mac Adams' winning design, selected from a group of over 100 entries, features a 15-foot-high black granite stele with the shape of a Korean War soldier cut out of the center. Also known as "The Universal Soldier," the figure forms a silhouette that allows viewers to see through the monument to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Adams also designed the piece to function as a sundial; every July 27 at 10 a.m. - the anniversary of the exact moment in New York when hostilities ceased in Korea - the sun shines directly through the soldier's head to illuminate the commemorative plaque installed in the ground near the piece.<br><br>

On of the three tiers in the based of the monument is decorated with mosaic flags of countries that participated in the U.N.-sponsored mission. The plaza's paving blocks are inscribed with the number of dead, wounded, and missing in action from each of the 22 countries that participated in the war. Korean War veterans are also commemorated in New York with the Brooklyn Korean War Veterans Plaza in Cadman Plaza and the Korean War Veterans Parkway, which was known as the Richmond Parkway until it was renamed in April 1997 by the New York State Legislature.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br> Municipal government long ago spilled out of City Hall to create the surrounding Civic Center. Today, Chambers Street and Foley Square are lined with white granite and marble civic buildings. The sumptuous lobby of the Surrogate’s Court at 31 Chambers Street (1899-1907), with marble walls and vaulted mosaic-covered ceiling, is often used as a location for television and movie scenes. Down the street, the Municipal Building at 1 Centre Street (McKim, Mead & White, 1914) raises classic white granite to skyscraper heights, in a building that straddles what used to be a continuation of Chambers Street. To the north, Centre and Lafayette streets form the oddly shaped Foley Square, now synonymous with the courts. Side by side sit the United States Courthouse at 40 Centre Street (Cass Gilbert, 1936) and the New York State Supreme Court (originally the New York County Courthouse) at 60 Centre Street (Guy Lowell, 1912-1926). Foley Square replaced a large part of the once infamous Five Points district &#8211; a collection of squalid, rundown houses on streets known as &#8220;Murderers Alley&#8221; and &#8220;Den of Thieves.&#8221; Violent gangs like the Dead Rabbits and the Plug Uglies eventually grew into organized crime syndicates.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Union Square W, New York, (On the left when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>One of three sculptural renditions of Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) in New York City’s parks, this larger-than-life bronze by Henry Kirke Brown (1814-1886) stands vigil on a busy crossroads at the north end of Union Square Park.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Hardin County (now Larue County), Kentucky, and was mostly self-educated. He settled in New Salem, Illinois, in 1831 and worked as a storekeeper, surveyor, and postmaster while studying law. In 1834, Lincoln was elected to the state legislature and served four terms, and was elected to Congress on the Whig ticket and served from 1847 to 1849. After this single term, he left politics and dedicated himself to a successful legal practice; it was not until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in 1854 threatened to expand the practice of slavery in the West did Lincoln rejoin the national arena. He lost two bids for the Senate in 1856 and 1858, but made an impression on his state and the nation over the course of seven debates with Democratic opponent Stephen A. Douglas.<br><br>Lincoln successfully ran for president as a Republican in 1860. While campaigning, he made his first visit to New York City in February 1860, and delivered a famous speech in Cooper Union’s Great Hall. By Inauguration Day in March 1861, seven southern states had seceded from the Union, and four more would follow in April. As the nation plunged into Civil War, Lincoln proved a skillful and thoughtful leader and orator. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation to free the slaves and delivered the Gettysburg Address that eloquently memorialized fallen soldiers.<br><br>Lincoln won re-election in 1864 against George McClellan. Five days after Confederate general Robert E. Lee’s surrender on April 9, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth while attending a play at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C. He died the next morning. Lincoln’s funeral cortege traveled to all the principal cities in the United States, and arrived in New York City on April 24. His body lay in state at City Hall. Lincoln is buried at Oak Ridge, Illinois, near Springfield.<br><br>Not long after Lincoln’s death, the statue of Lincoln was sponsored by the Union League Club, a Republican organization, which retained the services of the noted sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. Though Brown, like many of his generation, made an obligatory visit to Italy to study, he was part of a group of sculptors attempting to establish a truly American sculptural idiom. In his statue of Lincoln, cast in 1868, and dedicated September 16, 1870, he combines a classically styled pose with a perceptive naturalism, uniting realistic detail with an idealistic stance. Brown also created a similar portrait of Lincoln in Prospect Park (1869), and his nephew and pupil Henry Kirke Bush-Brown (1857-1935) crafted the bronze bust for Gettysburg’s Lincoln Memorial.<br><br>The sculpture originally stood in the street bed at the southwest corner of Union Square, at the location today occupied by the statue of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948). In 1875, <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> was protected by the installation of an elaborate stone and bronze rail fence, into which were inscribed from his second inaugural address, &#8220;with malice toward none; charity toward all.&#8221; Union Square Park was completely redesigned in 1930 to accommodate new subway construction, and the statue, minus its fence, was relocated to its current position in axial alignment with the <i>Independence Flagpole</i> (1930) and Henry Kirke Brown’s striking equestrian <i>George Washington</i> (1856) located at the park’s southern plaza. <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> was conserved in 1992.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Dover Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>FishBridge Park is located on the south side of Dover Street, from Pearl to Water Streets. It is between the Fulton Fish Market, to the south, and the Brooklyn Bridge, to the north. Of the two distinguished New York institutions, Fulton Fish Market is the older. In the 1820s several fish dealers set up shop in a few stalls in a corner of Fulton Market. In 1831 they moved across South Street to a shed along the river. Thirty-eight years later a building was erected as a permanent facility for the fish business.<br><br>In the early days most fish was delivered by fishing schooners and sloops. By the late 19th century new technologies such as refrigeration and express railroads made it possible to deliver fish from all over the United States, Canada, and even abroad. Fulton Fish Market became the largest in the country and one of the largest in the world. It is one of the last working areas of the Manhattan waterfront and one of the last examples of the city’s outdoor wholesale markets. Six days a week, from midnight until 9 a.m., the Fulton Fish Market is a dynamic bedlam of rubber-booted workers cleaning, boning, icing, unpacking, and repacking fish from throughout the world.<br><br>The Brooklyn Bridge is an aesthetic masterpiece and one of the world’s most iconic structures. With its intricate web of cables and its massive arched piers, the bridge was one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century: the world’s longest suspension bridge. Engineer John Augustus Roebling proposed this great link between Manhattan and Brooklyn in 1867. After his father’s death in 1869, Washington Roebling took his place as chief engineer. Paralyzed by caisson disease in 1872, the younger Roebling supervised operation from his apartment window and relayed instructions via his wife Emily Warren Roebling. The Brooklyn Bridge opened with great fanfare on May 24, 1883.<br><br>Reveling in the glory of its two namesakes, FishBridge Park is a community oasis of blooming roses, golden cosmos, and soaring morning glories on the site of a former parking lot and rat-infested garbage dump. Between 1990 and 1992, local volunteers cleaned up the site and built a garden children’s play area, barbecue, and dog run. In 1991 the City of New York leased the lot to the Seaport Community Coalition under Operation Green Thumb. The South-Water-Front Neighborhood Association became the overseer and then lease-holder of the garden in 1995. With the financial support of neighborhood residents and local businesses, an annual flea market, and grants from the City Parks Foundation and the MacDonald’s/Mollie Parnis Dress Up Your Neighborhood Award Program, volunteers transformed the ugly dump into a thriving park.<br><br>FishBridge Park celebrated two milestones in 1997. The first was the completion of the renovation of the upper park. The neighboring Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York funded the reconstruction project, which provided raised planters, a wrought-iron perimeter fence, and a pavement. The second achievement was the official designation of FishBridge Park as New York City parkland. The park is a hub for neighborhood activity, from gardening to dog-exercising, from reading to film-watching, from barbecuing to daydreaming, and especially for enjoying the park’s spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge. FishBridge Park is an example of how perseverance and goodwill can create a fine public space out of leftover vacant land.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Foley Square is named for Thomas F. &#8220;Big Tom&#8221; Foley (1852-1925), a prominent Democratic Party leader from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Foley left school at the age of thirteen to support his widowed mother, working for a period as a blacksmith’s helper. In 1877 he began his active connection with politics as a Tammany election district captain and rose to be First Assembly District leader.<br><br>Although Foley served as a member of the old City Council, as Alderman, and as Sheriff, he generally avoided elected office, preferring to sponsor others. His lasting gift to his party and indeed his Nation was to choose young Alfred E. Smith as candidate for the New York State Assembly in 1903. Smith rose to be Speaker, then Governor. In 1928 Smith would be the first Catholic to run for President.<br><br>At Foley’s death in 1925 Smith stated, &#8220;My personal and political welfare were as much a matter of concern to him as though I was his own son.&#8221; The New York Times ran the following headline about his funeral: &#8220;East Side Crowds Mourn the Passing of Almost the Last of Old-Time Leaders.&#8221; In 1926 the Board of Aldermen offered &#8220;Big Tom&#8221; and enduring tribute, when they named this city park, in the heart of New York’s government district, in his memory.<center>-- Daniel Patrick Moynihan, United States Senator</center>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Built by William Dyckman in approximately 1784, this house was once the center of a thriving farm more than 250 acres in size. Dyckman Farmhouse, along with the smokehouse and reconstructed &#8220;Hessian Hut,&#8221; has been a public museum since 1916.<br><br>Jan Dyckman arrived in New Amsterdam in the 1660s and began acquiring land in northern Manhattan. At the time of the American Revolution, Jan’s grandson William had inherited the Dyckman estate and the family homestead stood near present-day 210th Street and the Harlem River. During the British occupation of Manhattan (1776-83), William Dyckman and his wife Mary fled their home and sought refuge in upstate New York.<br><br>When the war ended, William returned to find his family’s home destroyed. It is believed that he immediately began building this new farmhouse, choosing a location further inland and on the newly re-routed Kingsbridge Road (now Broadway). The small two-story Dutch Colonial style home that William built served three generations of the Dyckman family. William’s son Jacobus took over in the 1790s, re-established the farm, and saw it prosper. After his death, Jacobus’ two bachelor sons Isaac and Michael inherited the farmhouse. By the 1850s, Isaac, Michael and their nephew Isaac Michael Dyckman moved away, marking the end of Dyckman family residency here.<br><br>Following Isaac’s death in 1868, Isaac Michael inherited much of the property. The farmhouse left family ownership by the 1870s and served primarily as rental housing for the next several decades. By the early 20th century, the farmhouse was in disrepair and the rural character of the neighborhood was changing.<br><br>To ensure the farmhouse’s preservation, Mary Alice Dyckman Dean and Fannie Fredericka Welch, daughters of Isaac Michael, bought the property in 1915. With their husbands, curator Bashford Dean and architect Alexander McMillian Welch, they undertook a major restoration project to bring the farmhouse back to what they believed was its earliest appearance. They furnished the interiors and landscaped the property. Also, a reproduction smokehouse and reconstructed &#8220;Hessian Hut&#8221; were added to the site. The Dyckman Farmhouse Museum is owned by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and is a member of the Historic House trust of New York City.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>The Dyckman Farm and the War</b><br>By the late 18th century, the Dyckman family owned approximately 250 acres, one of the largest farms in northern Manhattan. Their original home was located at the Harlem River, north of present day 207th Street. During the Revolutionary War (1775-1783), major military activity took place in the area of Manhattan. After forcing the British out of Boston in March of 1776, George Washington moved his troops to defend the port of New York. By August, the British assembled an enormous fleet in New York Harbor, carrying 45,000 British and Hessian soldiers. Although these soldiers defeated Washington at the Battle of Brooklyn, he maneuvered his army to northern Manhattan and managed to stop the British temporarily at the Battle of Harlem Heights. He tried one last time to defend New York at the Battle of Fort Washington in November of 1776, but failed. The British forces then occupied New York for the rest of the war. The Dyckman family, like many others, fled Manhattan and did not return until after the war. Upon their return, they found their home had been destroyed, so they built the present farmhouse on this site c. 1784.<br><br><b>Who were the Hessians?</b><br>During the Revolutionary War, the British hired approximately 30,000 German troops to assist in fighting. Their Prince, Frederick II, sold their service to the British and the largest number of them came from the State of Hessen-Kassel, so all of the German troops became known generically as &#8220;Hessians.&#8221; After the Revolutionary War, many Hessians stayed in America, settling predominantly in Reading and Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Fredericksburg, Maryland.<br><br><b>Hessian Hut</b><br>During the British occupation of New York, there was a Hessian soldier encampment of more than sixty huts constructed on Dyckman family land between present-day 201st and 204th Streets along Payson Avenue. Northern Manhattan remained a relatively rural area until the early 20th century, leaving many of its archaeological remains undisturbed. Amateur archaeologists and historians, including Reginald Pelham Bolton, began conducting digs throughout the area and in 1914 he discovered the Hessian encampment site on Payson Avenue. In 1915, Bolton and his colleagues reconstructed this hut on the grounds of the newly restored Dyckman Farmhouse. They moved the original stone floor, walls and fireplace and added timbers to create a full hut. This hut originally would have housed six to eight Hessians. During the excavation, Bolton also found items left by the soldiers, including bottles, buckles, buttons and ceramics. These items provide valuable insight into the lives of the soldiers who lived in the huts.<br><br>The Dyckman Farmhouse Museum is owned and operated by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and is a member of the Historic Trust of New York City.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Little Red Lighthouse stopped being used as a functional lighthouse long ago, but over the years this 40-foot-high structure has become a beacon of another kind. Located underneath the George Washington Bridge along this treacherous section of the Hudson River once known as Jeffrey’s Hook, this is one of the few surviving lighthouses in New York City and serves as a quaint reminder of the area’s history.<br><br>Long ago, Native Americans known locally as the Wiechquaesgeck-part of the Lenape tribe-inhabited much of upper Manhattan and eastern New Jersey. The Wichquaesgeck, and later the Dutch and English colonists, fished and hunted along the banks of the Hudson River. The Hudson was also an important route for travel, connecting upstate cities such as Albany to New York City and the Atlantic Ocean. As traffic increased along the river, so did the number of shipwrecks at Jeffrey’s Hook. In an attempt to reduce accidents, a red pole was placed at Jeffrey’s Hook jutting out over the river to warn travelers of danger. In 1889, two 10-candlepower lanterns were placed on the pole to aid navigation. Much of the land surrounding the lighthouse, including the riverbanks of Jeffrey’s Hook, was acquired by the City in 1896, and became known as Fort Washington Park.<br><br>In the early 20th century, barge captains carrying goods up and down the Hudson demanded a brighter beacon. The Little Red Lighthouse had been erected on Sandy Hook, New Jersey in 1880, where it used a 1,000 pound fog signal and flashing red light to guide ships through the night. It became obsolete and was dismantled in 1917. In 1921, the U.S. Coast Guard reconstructed this lighthouse on Jeffrey’s Hook in an attempt to improve navigational aids on the Hudson River. Run by a part-time keeper and furnished with a battery-powered lamp and a fog bell, the lighthouse, then known as Jeffrey’s Hook Lighthouse, was an important guide to river travelers for ten years. The George Washington Bridge opened in 1931, and the brighter lights of the bridge again made the lighthouse obsolete. In 1948, the Coast Guard decommissioned the lighthouse, and its lamp was extinguished.<br><br>The Coast Guard planned to auction off the lighthouse, but an outpouring of support for the beacon helped save it. The outcry from the public was prompted by the children’s book, <i>The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge</i>, written by Hildegarde Swift and Lynd Ward in 1942. In the popular book, the Little Red Lighthouse is happy and content until a great bridge is built over it. In the end, the lighthouse learns that it still has an important job to do and that there is still a place in the world for an old lighthouse. The classic tale captured the imaginations of children and adults, many of whom wrote letters and sent money to help save the icon from the auction block.<br><br>On July 23, 1951, the Coast Guard gave the property to Parks, and on May 29, 1979, the Little Red Lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It did not receive much attention over the years, until City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin worked with Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern to find funding for its restoration. In 1986, Parks hosted a party in honor of the lighthouse’s 65th anniversary and to celebrate a $209,000 renovation of the lighthouse that included reconstruction of the concrete foundation and the installation of new steel doors. In the year 2000, the lighthouse received a fresh coat of red paint that is true to its original, historic color, along with new interior lighting and electric lines. Today, the Little Red Lighthouse remains a stalwart symbol of the area’s heritage, lighting the way into the city’s past.<br><br>The Little Red Lighthouse is owned by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and is a member of the Historic House Trust of New York City.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Hudson River was essential to the history and economic development of New York. The river provided food for early settlers and is still an important waterway for commerce, which led to the expansion and growth of the City. The recognized source of the Hudson River is Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Mountains. The river flows for 315 miles and meets with the waters of the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor. In 1825 the Erie Canal was opened, connecting Lake Erie with the Hudson near Albany. It turned the river into a superhighway for barges carrying food and goods in both directions between New York City and the Midwestern states of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.<br><br>The rocky outcropping of Jeffrey’s Hook has always been a hazard for boats on the Hudson River at night. In 1889 a red warning light was set up on wooden poles, but a better light and audible warning for boats in fog were needed.<br><br>In 1921 the Coast Guard reassembled the lighthouse here with the name Jeffrey’s Hook Light. It is constructed of 48 cast iron plates and stands 40 feet tall. It is the southernmost lighthouse on the Hudson River and the only lighthouse on Manhattan Island. Nobody ever lived in it, but a part-time attendant ran the light.<br><br>Jeffrey’s Hook Light used a blinking acetylene lamp, focused by a 5th order Fresnel lens of cut glass prisms, and a fog bell to warn navigators away from the shore. For lighthouses to show pilots where they are in the dark, they each have a specific color or pattern of flashing called a ‘characteristic’ that pilots can recognize from a distance. The Little Red Lighthouse’s characteristic is one second of light followed by two seconds of darkness.<br><br><b>[ <i>Sidebar</i>: ]</b><br>The Little Red Lighthouse wasn’t always here. In 1880 it was erected on New Jersey’s Sandy Hook, to guide ships into New York Harbor. By 1917 it had become obsolete, so it was dismantled and put into storage. In 1921, it was reassembled here to warn boats about this dangerous spot of shoreline called Jeffrey’s Hook.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Only ten years after Jeffrey’s Hook Light was assembled here, the George Washington Bridge was built overhead. Under the bridge’s bright lights, the lighthouse became obsolete for the second time. In 1947, the Coast Guard decommissioned the lighthouse and its light was extinguished.<br><br>In 1951, the Coast Guard proposed to dismantle the lighthouse, but the public protested with an outpouring of letters to officials, largely because the lighthouse was a beloved character in the 1942 children’s book <i>The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge</i>, written by Hildegarde H. Swift and illustrated by Lynd Ward. The campaign to save the lighthouse was successful and on July 23, 1951 it came under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. In the book, the Little Red Lighthouse feels dwarfed by the George Washington Bridge. He feels unneeded and unwanted until one particularly foggy night when the Bridge calls to him, &#8220;Little brother, where is your light?&#8221; The Lighthouse wonders, &#8220;Am I brother of yours bridge? Your light was so bright that I thought mine was needed no more.&#8221; The Bridge replied, &#8220;I flash to the ships of the air. But you are still master of the river. Quick, let your light shine. Each to his own place, little brother!&#8221;<br><br>Today everybody knows the Jeffrey’s Hook Light as The Little Red Lighthouse, and its light shines on. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark. The Little Red Lighthouse is owned by the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation and is a member of the Historic House Trust of New York City.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 181st Street / Plaza Lafayette, New York, (In the median)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br> This plaza honors the prominent French statesman and military leader Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834). Lafayette is best remembered for his role in the Revolutionary War. Sympathetic to the American cause, he aided the colonists through the provision of experienced military leadership. The Frenchman quickly became a favorite of General George Washington, who appointed him Major General in the Continental Army during 1777. In 1778, Lafayette returned to France following the formal agreement of the France/United States alliance against Great Britain. Once in France, he actively lobbied for the allotment of increased military and financial aid. In 1780, Marquis de Lafayette returned to America and served valorously in the Virginia campaign, which forced the surrender of Lord Charles Cornwallis and Great Britain in 1781.<br><br>As a true proponent of democracy, Lafayette assumed a leading role in the French Revolution of 1789. He became a member of the National Assembly, from which he propagated a bill of rights based on the American Declaration of Independence. He commanded the French National Guard and the Feuillants, a moderate political party that advocated a constitutional monarchy. He gained leadership of a French division, during 1792, in the war against Austria. Chastised by the Jacobins, the radical opponents of the Feuillants, Lafayette fled to Flanders where Austrian authorities imprisoned him for five years. Upon his return to France, he avoided the politics of Dictator Napoleon Bonaparte. Following Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, Lafayette resumed his political career as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1815 and again, from 1818 to 1824. He toured the United States in 1824 during which time Congress presented him with a gift of $200,000 and a large tract of land. Marquis de Lafayette spent the remainder of his life in France and withheld the values of democracy, social equality, and religious freedom. <br><br>From its hillside location, Plaza Lafayette offers an unobstructed view of the George Washington Bridge. Located on 179th Street, the bridge is the city’s only above-water Hudson River crossing. The structure is composed of two 600 foot, arched towers that suspend the roadway 212 feet using four 4 foot steel cables. Massive anchorages located in Fort Washington Park and Fort Lee, New Jersey secure the cables. Designed by Othmar H. Ammann, the bridge opened in 1931 as the longest suspension span in the world. Originally, Ammann intened the arched towers to be encased in stone. The designer also proposed plans for a second, lower roadway. Although the planned masonry was never added, the Port of New York Authority added the lower roadway in 1962 to accommodate increased traffic. The George Washington Bridge serves as Interstate 95’s vital connection between New York and New Jersey, carrying the majority of mid-Atlantic traffic to New England. A graceful, light appearance and majestic nighttime illumination disguise the bridge’s tremendous traffic capacity. Renowned modernist architect Le Corbusier described the span as the most beautiful in the world.<br><br>Plaza Lafayette is located on 181st Street and is bounded by Riverside Drive and Haven Avenue. The City of New York acquired the property and placed it under Parks jurisdiction on February 23, 1918. The narrow strip is lined with five trees and lush greenery.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 59th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[One of a trio of bronze equestrian sculptures representing Latin American leaders, the Simon Bolivar statue commemorates a military general and advocate of Pan-Americanism. Bolivar (1783-1840) is credited with the liberation from Spanish domination of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Panama.<br><br>

R. De Las Cora designed the first statue of Simon Bolivar that was installed in Central Park in 1891 on a knoll near West 83rd Street, dubbed &#8220;Bolivar Hill.&#8221; Critics of the statue believed it did not live up to the original artistic vision and it was subsequently removed at the direction of the Park Board. Sculptor Giovanni Turinni submitted a second interpretation of Bolivar in 1897, but it was rejected by the National Sculpture Society, which at that time advised the Board on sculpture installations.<br><br>

In 1916, the Venezuelan government sponsored a worldwide competition to select a sculptor to render Bolivar. From 20 entrants, the committee selected Sally James Farnham (1876-1943), a relatively unknown sculptor. Farnham’s statue depicts Bolivar in full military dress upon his steed, which has its hoofs in the air. The sculpture was dedicated at Bolivar Hill on April 19, 1921. United States President Warren G. Harding (1865-1923), who spoke at the event, used the occasion to deliver a major policy address in which he urged greater cooperation between North and South America.<br><br>

In 1945, Six Avenue was renamed Avenue of the Americas at the suggestion of Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia (1882-19470), to honor Pan-American ideals and principles. A new plaza was designed where the avenue meets Central Park. The statue of Bolivar was moved to the eastern side of the plaza, placed on a new black granite pedestal designed by the firm of Clarke and Rapuano, and rededicated on April 19, 1951. A month later, the statue of Argentine general Jose de San Martin was unveiled on the plaza’s west side, and in 1965 the dynamic statue of Cuban poet and activist Jose Marti was dedicated between the two earlier works.<br><br>

In 1988, the Simon Bolivar statue was conserved through the Adopt-A-Monument Program, a joint venture of Parks, the Municipal Art Society, and the New York City Art Commission. The restored statue, now maintained by the Central Park Conservancy, remains a tangible symbol of the independence of Latin America.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This important example of military architecture is a dramatic reminder of the early defenses erected in New York Harbor to protect the City from invasion by sea. Like so many other early fortifications in this country, its star-shaped plan was inspired by the designs of Sebastien de Vauban, the great French military architect. The fort was completed in 1798 and named after John Jay, then Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Strengthened in 1806-1808, the massive walls, bristling with a hundred guns, helped to deter the British from attacking the City during the War of 1812. Today, it is under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>In 1902, Secretary of War Elihu Root asked the Prominent New York architectural firm of McKim, Meade & White to create a grand master plan for a new Army base on Governors Island. Part of Root’s vision was the expansion of the Island using excavated material from the construction of the Lexington Avenue Subway. This expansion more than doubled the size of the Island from 69 to 172 acres. Liggett Hall, completed in 1929, was the first structure constructed upon the land fill. For structural stability, the foundation of the massive 380,000 square foot building rests on steel piles driven down to the bedrock at the Island’s base.<br><br>Built to replace the rough, temporary wood frame structures erected for World War I housing, Liggett Hall housed an entire regiment: More than 2,500 men. The 16th Infantry Regiment, called &#8220;New York’s Own,&#8221; occupied the building from 1930 through 1940. Subsequent Army and Coast Guard uses altered the interior to reflect the needs of the time. The large center section above the monumental archway was a massive drill hall, over 200 feet long, where soldiers practiced Army formations and maneuvers. It was primarily used as a gymnasium in later years.<br><br>Liggett Hall is among the largest Army barracks ever constructed. Its length is approximately 1,050 ft., almost as long as the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan is high.<br><br>The imposing structure was named for General Hunter Liggett whose positions included Chief of Staff for the American Army in France during World War I.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Once known as Brick Row or Regimental Row and now as Colonels’ Row, the group of eight brick houses in front of you was built by the Army between 1893 and 1917. Although all were built to standard Army plans, slight variations over the years have made the houses unique. Most of the alterations took place around 1938 under the supervision of the Works Progress Administration &#8211; a program created to provide jobs for the nation’s growing number of unemployed during the Great Depression. Garages were added at this time, along with the impressive line of London Plane trees which front these houses along Hay Road.<br><br>The houses were built at a time when joining the Army was not a popular career choice because of its poor housing, low pay, and a slow career track. By 1900, the United States had become a world power and needed to modernize its Army while attracting and retaining good officers to lead it. Colonels’ Row was built, in part, to entice men to make the Army a career and provide their families with quality housing. The capacious houses average 12,500 square feet and included attic space for servants’ quarters, multiple bedrooms and full basements.<br><br>At the time of their construction, many of these houses fronted the southwest shore of the island. This prime beachfront location did not last for long. Beginning around 1900, the Army added landfill, extending the Island to the south by more than 100 acres. The officers’ views were no longer of the expansive harbor, but of barren new terrain. Eventually, the imposing bulk of Liggett Hall cut off the vista altogether. Despite the loss of a view, the houses remained an enticing feature for new officers.]]></desc>

A battery is a fortification equipped with artillery. This arrow-shaped fortification was built into the hillside overlooking Buttermilk Channel to the east of the Island. Its position provided protection against any attack through the channel from the harbor. A single story barracks was located inside.<br><br>From 1836 until 1878, the fortification became home to the Army Music School of Practice, a school for young, enlisted boys to become drummers and fife players. In 1878, the school was moved to Fort Jay, and South Battery was converted for use as an officers’ mess and Catholic chapel. In 1904, a major remodeling campaign converted the building to an amusement hall and lecture room for enlisted men. During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) &#8211; a program created to provide jobs to the nation’s growing number of unemployed &#8211; rebuilt the interior of Corbin Hall, a large room on the second floor, as a dining room and ballroom.<br><br>In 1939, the building was renovated for use as the Officers’ Club. The club was created to help meet the needs of active duty officers and the large number of very high ranking, retired Army officers who settled in New York City after World War II. The South Battery continued to serve as the Officer’s Club for the Coast Guard until 1996 and was used for banquets, weddings, dances and other social functions.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Kimmel Road, Governors Island, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This view looks over the Buttermilk Channel to the Brooklyn waterfront, located only 400 yards away. Many theories surround the naming of this narrow waterway. In years past, the channel was much wider and shallower than it is today &#8211; before the piers and the dredging of the channel gave it its current appearance. The waters in this channel were rough and fast, leading to two theories: one, that the appearance of the white water looked like buttermilk; and two, that the fast rough action of the water was actually used to help churn Brooklyn farmers’ milk. Another theory was that cattle actually crossed the channel to graze on Governors Island. Walt Whitman wrote, &#8220;as late as the Revolutionary War cattle were driven across from Brooklyn, over what is now Buttermilk Channel, to Governors Island.&#8221;<br><br>Across the channel, the Brooklyn waterfront was one of the busiest waterfronts in the nation. The introduction of the steamship in 1815 and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 meant that the demand for waterfront space was high. Land in Brooklyn was cheaper and more spacious than lower Manhattan and the shipping industry exploded in this area Activity along the waterfront declined in the 1950s when shipping shifted to container systems and less manpower was needed. Though much of the container shipping industry moved to New Jersey, you can still see a functioning shipping industry across the channel.<br><br>Along the waterfront to the right, you can see the Atlantic Basin, where a cutting-edge shipyard was built in 1840, with a 200 foot opening and room for 150 ships to be protected on all sides &#8211; a unique design at the time. The basin remains today with the terminal for the Queen Mary II and other cruise ships at its southern end. Today, a long swath of the waterfront south of the Brooklyn Bridge will be the site of the new Brooklyn Bridge Park.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This imposing residence is the Commanding Officer’s Quarters, also known as the Admiral’s House (after the most recent Coast Guard residents.) Built in the Greek revival style, it was completed in 1843. The house was designed by prominent New York architect Martin E. Thompson, who is best known locally for the design of The Arsenal in Central Park.<br><br>Throughout its occupancy, the building was home to the Island’s highest ranking officer and his family. Until 1966, that person was the Army commander. The commander was in charge of such notable commands as the Department of the East, the Second Corps Area and the First Army, which was first modern U.S. Army combat organization. After the 1966 transfer of the Island from Army to Coast Guard control, the house became the quarters of the admiral in command of the Coast Guard Atlantic Area, the U.S. Coast Guard’s largest command extending from the Caribbean to the Arctic.<br><br>The large residence is more than 12,000 square feet. It was formally furnished and often used by the commander in residence to entertain visiting dignitaries. Many of the original features remain, including the ornate mantelpieces and woodwork. Unique among the other buildings in the Governors Island Historic District, the interior has been designated historically significant.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Barry Road, Governors Island, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Governor’s House was constructed in 1813 as a guardhouse for the Island. Its location on a bluff overlooking Buttermilk Channel and the primary Island dock was ideally suited for this purpose. By 1824, it was used as the residence for the commanding officer of the post. The commanding officer continued to live here until the Commanding Officer’s Quarters, located two doors to the south, was completed in 1843. At that time, the Governor’s House was used as offices for the post commander, while the basement continued to be used as a guardhouse until approximately 1863.<br><br>The name &#8220;Governor’s House&#8221; is a misnomer as no New York State governor ever occupied the building. In 1698, the British officially acquired the Island and English colonial governors established a headquarters here, resulting in the name &#8220;Governors Island.&#8221; The house may have been called &#8220;the Governor’s House&#8221; due to its proximity to the location of the original English colonial governor’s residence, which no longer survives.<br><br>The house was altered many times over the years. The most dramatic of these changes was the removal of the original two-story porches located on the east and west facades of the building, and the addition of the garage and patio at its rear. The majority of the alterations were made in the 1830s when the roof and porches were changed. The rear garage addition was created in the 1930s.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Dutch East India Company commissioned Henry Hudson to identify a northwest passage to the Indies. As a part of that effort, Hudson entered New York Bay on September 11, 1609 in his vessel The Half Moon and sailed up the river that now bears his name. Over the next 15 years, the area was surveyed by company representatives while temporary trading outposts were established.<br><br>For the Dutch to establish permanent territorial claim in the area, they needed not only to discover and chart the area, but settle it as well. In part to achieve this, a party of Dutch settlers wintered on Governors Island in 1624, which they termed Nooten Eylamdt. The area’s inhabitants at the time of the Dutch arrival were the Lenape Indians, one of the oldest of the Algonquian tribes. Nooten Eylandt is thought to be the Dutch translation of the Lenape name &#8220;Pagganack&#8221; or &#8220;Nut Island.&#8221;<br><br>After approximately one year on Governors Island, many Dutch relocated to Manhattan while others used the island as a jumping off point to settle outposts north along the Hudson River. The Dutch built a sawmill on Governors Island to mill the valuable nut trees into lumber for some of Manhattan’s first buildings. An archeological study has identified possible signs of this sawmill in the area where you stand. Unlike the well known water powered European windmills of the period, this was most likely a wind powered mill of unique Durch design.<br><br>In 1637, Wouter van Twiller, the governor of the New Amsterdam colony, is thought to have traded nominal trinkets with the Lenape for Governors Island. Van Twiller anticipated using the Island for his personal use. The trade was undertaken in the same manner as Peter Minuit when he traded trinkets for Manhattan Island in 1626. The concept of property sale of this sort was not known in Lenape culture and they were not likely to have considered the arrangement permanent. Upon van Twiller’s removal from the governor position, the Island reverted to the public domain. Through the Treaty of Westminster in 1674 the Dutch ceded the Island to the British.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>During the first seven decades of American military use of Governors Island, there was no post chapel. In 1844, a Columbia College Episcopal Reverend, John M. McVickar, was commissioned post chaplain. His tireless efforts, combined with the sponsorship of his family and Trinity Church in Manhattan, led to the construction of a sizable wood frame chapel in 1847. This Episcopalian chapel was located just behind and to the right of where you are standing. By 1868, the Army elected to stop providing chaplains to the Island, leading Trinity Church to adopt the chapel into its Manhattan parish and provide its own chaplain.<br><br>Reverend Edmund Banks Smith arrived in 1904 and energetically spearheaded the construction of a new masonry building to replace the original wood chapel, then in disrepair. The current English Gothic Style church was dedicated in 1906; and, like the original, was named after a soldier and early convert to Christianity, St. Cornelius the Centurion. Trinity Church retains ownership of the chapel to this day. Eventually, facilities for further religious services were made available to Island residents. The Our Lady of the Sea Catholic chapel and a synagogue were established in the historic district and services for Christian Scientists and Jehovah Witnesses were held in existing buildings on the south island.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Governors Island boasts a long military history and has played an important role in every major American military engagement since the Revolutionary War, including the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I, World War II and the Gulf War. First settled by the Dutch in 1624, the Island became a permanent US Army facility after 1800, and more recently, the Atlantic Area headquarters of the US Coast Guard.<br><br>Original Lenape Indian residents may have called the Island &#8220;Pagganack,&#8221; a name that refers to the abundance of nut trees. The subsequent Dutch occupants called the Island &#8220;Nooten Eyland,&#8221; their translation of Pagganack. In the late 1700s, Britain designated Governors Island as belonging to &#8220;His Majesty’s Governors,&#8221; thus generating the name &#8220;Governors Island,&#8221; which it retains to this day.<br><br><b>Governors Island Timeline</b><br>   • 1524: Giovanni da Verazzano sights Governors Island<br>   • 1624: The Island is the first place settled by the Dutch West India Company in New York Harbor.

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The design and layout of Governors Island National Historic District owes much of its development to changing times and roles. From early Dutch settlement to its incarnations as a military base to the US Army and the Coast Guard, Governors Island has evolved over the past three hundred years.<br><br>In many ways, however, the Island’s appearance is due to the vision of the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, for its significant layout and the design of many of its most distinctive institutional buildings.<br><br>McKim, Mead & White were at the top of their field at the turn of the 19th century. The firm’s work included the original New York Penn Station in 1905, the Boston Public Library in 1887, and the Columbia University Plan in 1893. The firm won widespread acclaim for their design of the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, an internationally attended spectacle highlighting classical architecture.<br><br>At the beginning of the 20th century, Secretary of War Elihu Root, a New York lawyer and acquaintance of several of the firm’s principals, commissioned McKim, Mead & White to design new campuses for several Army posts across the country, including Governors Island. Their original design for the Island, based on Beaux Arts principles, proposed an entire new campus on the recently created south island and retained only Castle Williams, Fort Jay, and the South Battery in the north.<br><br>However, War Department interest in the new expansion waned, funding dried up and principals of the firm all passed away. By the time a final plan was adopted in 1928, much of the original scheme was abandoned.<br><br>Nevertheless, the influence of McKim, Mead & White is evident, particularly in the construction of Building 400 (Liggett Hall). The structure was the first permanent building built on the Island’s landfill and defines the southern boundary of the historic district. In addition, the balance of the large brick buildings in the historic district was inspired by the original Beaux Arts plan.]]></desc>

It provided officers stationed here a unique recreational opportunity and provided a way to hone their riding skills. Polo was first introduced to the United States in Manhattan in 1876.<br><br>Between 1900 and 1911 landfill was added to Governors Island creating nearly 100 acres of flat land. After the removal of many temporary warehouses constructed on this part of the Island during World War I, this open space provided an excellent location for a polo field.<br><br>Governors Island boasted two well respected teams, the Blues and the Yellows. They hosted matches with teams from the Army, National Guard, R.O.T.C.s from eastern colleges and private polo clubs. The matches were reported nationally, receiving coverage in the New York Times and elsewhere. Polo was often used as a way to entertain visiting dignitaries. During many match days, the Island was open to the public, providing ordinary New Yorkers a rare glimpse of the Army installation that was off-limits to them throughout the rest of the year.<br><br>In the early 1940’s, polo playing ceased on the Island. The military was preparing for World War II and players and horses were unavailable for matches. The final match on the Island was played in 1941 between a Governors Island team and notable civilian players. However, the polo tradition carried on with demonstration matches by the Coast Guard from 1966-1996 and continues even today during the summer season.]]></desc>

Nevertheless, performances were a part of life on the Island for many years. Early performances took place in an old YMCA building near Castle Williams, then in the new YMCA (sill standing) next door to this theater. In 1939, a new movie theater was constructed under the supervision of the Army Motion Picture Service, which was responsible for theaters on bases across the country. First-run movies were shown here, as well as productions from an active live theater program. During 1941, draftees with experience in civilian theater were called on to produce and stage professional quality shows to raise troop morale.<br><br>In order to support the war effort, Broadway music composer Irving Berlin helped produce a show about World War II called &#8220;This is the Army.&#8221; The show was inspired by a performance he saw at the Fort Jay Theater in 1942. The theater continued to show movies to Army and then Coast Guard personnel and their families until the base closed in 1996. At that time, double features of first-run films on Friday night cost two dollars!]]></desc>

Pershing, General of the Armies and First Commander of the First Army in 1918. Pershing led all the American Army forces in World War I. The architect of Pershing Hall was Lorimer Rich, once an employee of the firm McKim, Meade & White, whose Island-wide plans and designs for many of its largest buildings shaped the look of 20th century Governors Island. Rich is best known for his design of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia.<br><br>During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created to provide jobs for the country’s masses of unemployed. Part of this initiative was the Federal Arts Program (FAP), giving employment to countless artists and craftspeople. Many Governors Island buildings were updated or expanded as part of the WPA program, and Pershing Hall benefited from a FAP commission to Tom Loftin Johnson for murals to adorn its principal hallways.

The arsenal was part of the Ordnance Department of the Army and was considered its own Army post, functioning separately from Fort Jay. The New York Arsenal did not manufacture arms, but its staff inspected, purchased and took delivery of arms and artillery from private contractors. The arsenal also functioned as a warehouse and as a distribution center of arms to Army posts across the country. During non-combat years, the arsenal yards held excess artillery and cannon balls to be redistributed to other posts, given away to small towns to become war memorials, or sold as scrap metal or slightly &#8220;used&#8221; weapons to other countries.<br><br>The arsenal was established on 6.5 acres in and around the area now occupied by Pershing Hall. The location was behind and downhill from Fort Jay, allowing a clear field of fire from the fort’s cannons. After the Civil War, the fields of fire were no longer required, and the arsenal expanded along the Island’s north shore toward Castle Williams. The arsenal buildings are some of the oldest on the Island and include Quarters 135, the residence for the New York Arsenal’s commanding officer and Buildings 104, 105, 107, 109, 110 and 140, to either side of the ferry dock, which served as offices and storehouses. Following World War I, the arsenal was closed and its functions transferred to the Raritan Arsenal, New Jersey.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Oyster reefs were once a key feature of the New York / New Jersey Harbor Estuary’s ecosystem. Oysters helped to feed New Amsterdam residents, particularly in winter when other foods were scarce. Oysters in fact remained the most common local street food through the 19th century. Yet as New York City grew, overfishing, pollution and siltation took their toll on the Harbor’s oyster beds. By 1900, these were largely depleted or destroyed. Despite the fact that harvesting from any remaining beds was outlawed during the 1920s, the oysters never really returned.<br><br>Thanks to federal mandates and local investments, water quality in the Harbor has improved significantly in the last several decades. Oysters have begun to reappear, but only in some places, and in small numbers. In 1998, The River Project, an environmental organization based in Lower Manhattan, observed a significant &#8220;set&#8221; of wild oysters on the pilings beneath Pier 26 in Tribeca. The number of wild oysters on these pilings has increased since then, but not significantly.<br><br>A complete recovery of the oyster population in the Harbor appears to be hindered by a lack of oyster habitat &#8211; the reefs themselves, which chemically attract larval oysters and provide a surface to which they can attach.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Oyster Middens, or piles of discarded shells, once littered the landscape of Manhattan and its neighboring shores, a testament to the astonishing abundance of the indigenous European Oyster, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>. Archaeologists have discovered many middens around the world, left behind by native peoples for whom oysters and other shellfish were a food staple, sometimes providing the only evidence of diet for nomadic, hunter-gatherer tribes.<br><br>Middens, however, are not just about history. As part of the Oyster Restoration Research Project, large piles of oyster shells that have dried out in the sun are used in spat-on-shell aquaculture, where floating larvae attach themselves to the shells’ substrate. Crushed shell is also used to build restoration reef sites. The shells are provided by Oceania Restaurant in midtown Manhattan and are a great asset to the ORRP. Here’s to bringing back The Big Oyster!]]></desc>

Although it boasts a law school in White Plains, an environmental center in Pleasantville, and international programs on four continents, Pace has never lost sight of its roots: a school offering innovation and opportunity to a student body drawn from the strivers among each new generation of New Yorkers.<br><br><b>On &#8220;Newspaper Row&#8221;</b><br>Pace University has been located near Park Row &#8211; once known as &#8220;Newspaper Row&#8221; because of the many newspaper headquarters there &#8211; since the Pace brothers rented their first classroom at 154 Nassau Street, home of the old <i>New York Tribune</i>.<br><br><b>The Pace Brothers</b></b><br>Homer St. Clair Pace, preparing for a certified public accountant exam, found &#8220;very little and very poor instruction along these lines&#8221; &#8211; an extraordinary lack here in the country’s financial center. Seeing and opportunity, Homer and his brother Charles borrowed $600 to open a one-classroom business school. Pace University &#8211; that classroom’s descendant, now expanded into multiple campuses, not to mention Pace global centers in China, Brazil and Italy &#8211; recently celebrated its hundredth anniversary.<br><br><b>Student Body</b><br>Pace’s student body has been effortlessly diverse from its beginnings. The first class of 13 included three women &#8211; 17 years before the constitutional amendment granted women the vote in 1920 &#8211; and students of color joined the Pace community early in its history. Over the decades, countless Pace students &#8211; including newcomers from across the country and around the world &#8211; have been the first in their family to attend college.]]></desc>

These tens of billions of dollars’ worth of gold bars, each numbered and weighed, are stored five stories underground in 122 compartments in a vault closed with a steel door weighing 90 tons. Most of the gold at the Federal Reserve belongs to foreign governments and international organizations. They store their gold here for three reasons: first, the Bank’s location in the heart of the U.S. financial center; second, its unrivalled security; and third, the ease of trading when many countries keep their gold in the same building. As countries originally made payments to each other, gold bars could simply be wheeled from one country’s vault to the next &#8211; no need to crate them for long ocean voyages, no fear of disaster at sea.<br><br>The New York Fed is one of twelve regional Reserve Banks nationwide, part of the Federal Reserve System created in 1913 to supervise American banking.

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Riverside Drive, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>      William Ordway Partridge (1861-1930) sculpted this bronze, larger-than-life figure of attorney and public servant Samuel Jones Tilden (1814-1886). It was dedicated October 5, 1926.<br><br>      Tilden was born on February 9, 1814 in New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York. As an undergraduate, he studied at both Yale University and the University of the City of New York (now New York University). He graduated from Yale in 1837. Tilden enrolled the following year as a law student at the University of the City of New York. Tilden was admitted to the bar in 1841 and he practiced law in New York City. His high-profile clients included more than half the railway corporations north of the Ohio and between the Hudson and Missouri Rivers. Although he probably did not graduate from any law school, Yale University awarded him an honorary L.L.B. in 1875.<br><br>      Tilden was active in city, state, and national politics. Elected to the state assembly in 1845, he also served in the Constitutional Convention of 1846 and ran on the Democratic ticket for Attorney General in 1855. He was a member of the Free Soil movement, which fought the extension of slavery into U.S. Territories. In 1863, Tilden moved into a home on Gramercy Park. He combined that house with an adjacent townhouse in 1874 to form a mansion where he resided until his death. The mansion has been the home of the National Arts Club since 1905.<br><br>       By 1868, Tilden had assumed the leadership of the Democratic Party in New York State. In 1870, he launched a high-profile attack on the Tweed Ring, which had dominated New York City government from 1860 to 1871. Tilden helped to impeach several judges, exposed the plunder amassed by certain Tweed officials, prosecuted many of them on behalf of the state, and described the Ring’s illegal dealings in the pages of the <i>New York Times</i>.<br><br>       Campaigning as a reform candidate for the Democrats, Tilden was elected Governor of New York State in 1874. His anti-corruption platform won him the Democratic presidential nomination in 1876. Although Tilden won a majority of the popular vote, he lost the Electoral College vote, 185-184, to Rutherford B. Hayes. The election is widely regarded as having been stolen by the Republicans, who formed a majority of the commission that was appointed to determine the vote of three Southern states, each of which had two sets of electors. He died at his country home, known as Greystone, in Yonkers on August 4, 1886.<br><br>       Tilden left a fortune of several million dollars. His bequest of his large book collection, as well as six million dollars, ultimately led to the creation of the New York Public Library. He also set aside $50,000 for a commemorative statue to be erected in his honor. Tilden’s heirs contested his will, squandering much of his amassed wealth in the process, and delayed both his bequest to the library and the installation of this statue. Disagreement over the site as well as disputes between the sponsors and the sculptor postponed installation of the monument a staggering 40 years after Tilden’s death. The original design by architects Wilder and White placed the monument within an exedra located at Park Avenue and 34th Street, but extant plans for street improvements at that spot forced the designers to this alternate location.<br><br>       The Tilden statue is one of more than a dozen monuments that grace Riverside Drive. William Ordway Partridge depicted Tilden in a solemn stance, his hand resting on a copy of the United States Constitution. One of Tilden’s biographers said that this document was, along with Jefferson’s writings, his &#8220;Mother Goose.&#8221; Given his disputed loss in the Electoral College, the inscription in the pedestal is not without irony: it reads, &#8220;I trust the people.&#8221; The sculpture is set within a terrace paved with river stone, and is framed by granite benches. Partridge also sculpted the statues of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton on the campus of Columbia University, as well as the Grant equestrian statue in Brooklyn’s Grant Square Gore.<br><br>       In 2000, the City Parks Foundation Monuments Conservation Program restored the statue. The terrace, surrounding landscape, and <i>Lajos Kossuth</i> statue were renovated by a $350,000 capital project funded by Council Member, now Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fileds.<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>Michael R. Bloomberg, Mayor<br>Adrian Benepe, Commissioner<br>December 2001</center>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       This bronze equestrian sculpture of military officer, educator, journalist, and public servant Franz Sigel (1824-1902) is by the distinguished sculptor Karl Bitter (1867-1915). Sigel is also honored with a park named for him, which is located at 158th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.<br><br>       Sigel was a patriot both in his native land of Germany and in his adopted home in the United States. He was born on November 18, 1824, in Sinsheim, Baden. He completed his studies at the Gymnasium of Bruchsal, graduated from the military academy of Karlsruhein 1843, and then became a lieutenant in the grand ducal service. However, his liberal views were in conflict with the existing regime. After leading an unsuccessful revolutionary force in 1848, he was forced to flee to Switzerland. He traveled in exile to England in 1851, and then to the United States a year later.<br><br>       After settling in New York City in 1852, he taught in public schools and German schools, co-founded the German-American Institute, joined the Fifth New York Militia, and wrote for the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Staats-Zeitung</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>. He moved to St. Louis in 1857 to teach at the German-American Institute.<br><br>       At the outset of the American Civil War, Sigel formed a regiment that helped to keep Missouri and its federal arsenal for the Union. Rising to the rank of major general in the Union Army, he fought in several decisive campaigns including Pea Ridge and the Second Battle of Bull Run. He is credited with encouraging many German-Americans to fight for the Union. Sigel returned to New York in 1867, first working in the transportation industry and then serving in various positions in local and federal government. He then resumed his career in journalism as the publisher of the <i>New York Deutsches Volksblatt</i> and editor of the <i>New York Monthly</i>. He died on August 21, 1902.<br><br>       In 1904, a monument committee commissioned Karl Bitter to sculpt his portrait. Bitter was born in Austria and trained in Europe before immigrating to the United States in 1889. He created numerous sculptures for wealthy private clients such as the Vanderbilts and Astors, as well as many public works of art, including the statue of <i>Carl Schurz</i> (1913) in Morningside Park. Before his death in a car accident, he modeled the maquette for the figure of <i>Pomona</i> atop the <i>Pulitzer Fountain</i> (1913-1916) in Manhattan’s Grand Army Plaza. His masterful portrait of Sigel was one in a series of sculptures he made of foreign-born American military heroes, including the Marquis de Lafayette and Baron Von Steuben.<br><br>       With the <i>Franz Sigel </i> commission, Bitter took great care in determining its location at the top of a staircase where West 106th Street meets Riverside Drive. The granite pedestal projects beyond the top step and rests on a secondary stone base. It was dedicated in 1907. In 1941 Sigel’s bronze sword was dislodged and reattached by Parks crews, and was later removed to storage and safekeeping. In the late 1980s, the Parks monuments crew cleaned and waxed the statue, and the monument is presently slated for conservation and restoration of the sword. Recent horticultural enhancements to the adjoining hillside have been supported by the Greenstreets program and the Riverside Park Fund.<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>November 2001</center>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       This impressive bronze equestrian sculpture of 15th century French patriot and martyr Joan of Arc (1411-1431) is one of the finest works of art in the Parks collection. Created by the eminent artist and art patron Anna Vaughn Hyatt Huntington (1876-1973), the piece was dedicated in 1915.<br><br>       Jeanne La Pucelle, later known as Joan of Arc, was a peasant maiden said to have been divinely inspired to help liberate the French from English rule. Through her determination, she was able to gain an audience with the Dauphin of France, later to be King Charles VII, at the time when the city of Orleans was under siege. Charles appointed her commander-in-chief of a small provisional army, which under her inspired command forced the English to withdraw in 1429. With the siege lifted, the Dauphin was crowned in Reims Cathedral, with Joan seated in the place of honor next to him.<br><br>       Though a popular figure, Joan was restrained by the new King from marching on Paris. In 1430, while conducting an unofficial campaign, she was captured by Burgundian soldiers at Compiegne, and sold to the English, who charged her with witchcraft and heresy. She was subjected to a long trial in a French ecclesiastical court presided over by the Bishop of Beauvais, and was eventually found guilty and condemned to death. On May 31, 1431, she was burned at the stake. Twenty years later an investigation into Joan’s trial proceedings led to the annulment of her sentence. On May 16, 1920, nearly 500 years later, Jeanne la Pucelle was canonized as Saint Joan by Pope Benedict XV.<br><br>       The exploits of this heroine from the Middle Ages have been revisited by authors and artists ever since her death. Among the many notable works surrounding her myth are Mark Twain’s novel The Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1896), a fictionalized account of her life, playwright George Bernard Shaw’s political play Saint Joan (1923), and Carl-Theodor Dreyer’s landmark silent film, The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928).<br><br>       In New York, a prominent group of citizens formed a Joan of Arc monument committee in 1909. Their efforts coincided with those of a young sculptor, Anna Hyatt Huntington, to create a sculpture of Joan. Her first version, in which she emphasized &#8220;the spiritual rather than the warlike point of view,&#8221; was submitted to the prestigious Salon in Paris. It received an honorable mention from the jury, nevertheless skeptical that such an accomplished work of art could have been made solely by a woman.<br><br>       The New York monument committee, headed by J. Sanford Saltus, was so impressed by her work, that they awarded her the commission. Architect John van Pelt was retained to design the pedestal, which is made of Mohegan granite composed of Gothic-style blind arches, decorated with coats of arms. A few limestone blocks from the tower in Rouen where Joan of Arc had been imprisoned were incorporated into the base. Van Pelt situated the monument at the top of the steps in the park island at 93rd Street and Riverside, and had planted a screen of trees to shield the statue from the buildings behind it.<br><br>       Huntington’s version is both heroic and infused with naturalistic detail. For Joan’s armor, she conducted research at the arms and armory division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the refinement of the equine anatomy was based on a horse borrowed from the fire department of her native town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Her niece posted astride a barrel, as she modeled the figure, first nude, then in costume.<br><br>       On December 6, 1915, the sculpture was unveiled in an elaborate ceremony, which included a military band and French Ambassador Jean J. Jusserand. Mrs. Thomas Alva Edison was among those selected to pull the cord that released the shroud. Huntington went on to have a long and illustrious career, and also sculpted the statue of the Cuban patriot, Jose Marti (1965), which stands at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas. A replica of Joan of Arc stands in front of the Palace of the Legion of Honor in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.<br><br>       In 1939, Parks repaired Joan’s sword, which had been broken, repatined the bronze statue, and repaired the staircase. In 1987, the sculpture again underwent a full conservation financed by the Grand Marnier Foundation through the Municipal Art Society’s Adopt-A-Monument Program,<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>Michael R.

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Riverside Drive, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       Rich in history, the plain of Claremont Playground has been the site of a Revolutionary War battle, a country estate, a fashionable inn, and a children’s recreation area. This was the scene of fierce combat during the Battle of Harlem Heights, fought on September 16, 1776. Michael Hogan, a former British Consul in Havana, purchased land here in 1806 and built the Federal-style Claremont Mansion (for which Claremont Avenue is named). Possible sources of the name are the elevated site’s scenic outlook; Hogan’s birthplace in County Clare, Ireland; and the title of his friend Prince William, Duke of Clarence, who would ascend the English throne as King William IV in 1830.<br><br>       After a series of owners, the mansion came to be used as a popular roadside inn by 1860. The City acquired the property in 1873 for the development of Riverside Park and continued to operate the inn. At the turn of the century, the Claremont Inn and its formal gardens attracted visits from numerous politicians, military officials, socialites, and entertainers including President William McKinley, Admiral George Dewey, Lillian Russell, and members of the Morgan, Vanderbilt, and Whitney families. By 1907 it was a public restaurant, serving house specialties like curry of chicken Claremont to such notables as Cole Porter, George S. Kaufman, George M. Cohan, Fannie Hurst, and James J. Walker. Claremont Inn burned down in 1950, and a new playground was constructed on the site within two years.<br><br>       There are an impressive array of monuments and structures near the playground. To the west, the Amiable Child Monument (1797) marks the grave of St. Claire Pollock, the five-year-old boy who fell to his death on nearby rocks or drowned in the Hudson River. To the south stands majestic Grant’s Tomb, designed by architect John Duncan and sculptor John Massey Rhind. The neoclassical structure, modeled on the tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus, was dedicated in memory of U.S. President and General Ulysses S. Grant on April 27, 1897. Other nearby landmarks include the Riverside Viaduct (1901), Sakura Park (acquired in 1896), and a tablet presented by representatives of the Chinese empire in memory of General Grant (1897).<br><br>       The Claremont-Sakura Playground Association was founded in 1994, with assistance from Riverside Park Fund, to improve and maintain the area. Their efforts helped secure the $635,000 capital reconstruction of Claremont Playground, which was funded by the Manhattan Borough President in 1996. The reconstruction project was completed in 1998. It included installing new play equipment, safety surfacing, pavements and curbs, benches, and gates; reconstructing the drainage and water systems; and planting new trees.<br><br>       The playground’s water and wildlife theme was inspired by the history and environment of the Hudson River Valley. Decorations include medallions of native fauna and a weathervane shaped like a peregrine falcon. The spray shower and three play animals are dolphins, which are not native to the Hudson River but have been sighted in the region on rare occasions since the settlement of New Amsterdam in 1624. A boat-shaped sandbox with a seahorse figurehead and a compass rosette depicting the historic Sloop Clearwater help visitors navigate a course through the playground.<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>Michael R.

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Riverside Drive, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       For many years on March 15th, Hungarian Independence Day has been celebrated on Riverside Drive at the monument to patriot Lajos Kossuth (1802-94). The bronze tableau portrays a vignette of the struggle for Hungarian independence in 1848. Atop a pedestal of Milford pink granite, a larger-than-life figure of Kossuth motions to two other male figures at the base: a revolutionary soldier and an aged peasant, representing Hungary’s new republic and old regime.<br><br>       Kossuth was born to a family of noble heritage in Monok in northeastern Hungary. In the early 1830s, he emerged as a leader of the country’s radical reform movement. Trained as a lawyer, Kossuth edited several journals and newspapers that allowed him to broadcast his increasingly popular ideas. He issued fiery pleas for Hungary’s independence from Vienna’s Hapsburg Monarchy, for emancipation of the peasants, and for industrial development. Kossuth was elected to the Hungarian Diet (national assembly) in 1847, and a year later he led the revolution that created a new national government for Hungary.<br><br>       The new government fell to invading Russian and Austrian armies in 1849, and Kossuth fled into exile. Rallying support for Hungarian independence, he dazzled European and American audiences with his eloquence. Sympathizers in the United States identified with the aims of overthrowing the foreign monarchy and establishing republican government for Hungary. Kossuth visited New York in December 1851 at the start of a seven-month tour of the United States. Upon arrival, he was given a tremendous welcome, described in the newly-founded New York Times as one of &#8220;the most magnificent and enthusiastic ever extended to any man in any part of the world.&#8221; A reception hosted by Mayor Ambrose C. Kingsland, banquets, and a parade up Fifth Avenue were held in his honor. Kossuth lived in exile in England and (after 1865) in Italy. After his death in Turin in March 1894, his body was brought to Budapest and buried in state.<br><br>       On March 15, 1928, a crowd of 25,000 gathered at Riverside Drive and 113th Street to dedicate the monument to Lajos Kossuth, designed by Hungarian sculptor Janos Horvai (1873-1944) and funded by American citizens of Magyar origin. The ceremony was not without controversy. The delegation of 520 Hungarian public officials encountered a protest denouncing the conservative Horthy government for &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; in honoring Kossuth and his liberal ideals. In 1930, the monument had to be dismantled due to poor fabrication; later a second cast was installed. The monument was originally intended to feature three bronze panels depicting scenes in the life of Kossuth; instead, in 1930, Horvai presented the panels to the First Hungarian Reformed Church, located at 344 East 69th Street.<br><br>       Riverside Drive stretches along Riverside Park from W. 72nd Street north to Dyckman Street. In consideration of New York’s northward expansion, the City acquired land between the Hudson River Railroad and the rocky bluffs along the river in 1866-67 for a park and scenic drive. The original 1875 plan, by Central Park co-designer Frederick Law Olmsted, called for a park with a picturesque drive winding along the natural contours of the land. Twenty-five years later, the result was an English-style rustic park and a formal tree-lined boulevard. A fashionable address at the turn of the century, Riverside Drive attracted a collection of substantial neoclassical apartment houses and mansions along its east side. The Drive’s majestic elevation also made it an impressive location for colossal monuments and institutions, including Grant’s Tomb (1897) and Riverside Church (1930). The Kossuth tableau is one of more than a dozen monuments which adorn Riverside Drive, including sculptures of Samuel Tilden (1926), Joan of Arc (1915), and Franz Sigel (1907).<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>Michael R.

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       The Firemen’s Memorial (1913) in Riverside Park is one of the most impressive monuments in New York City. The monument was designed by H. Van Buren Magonigle (1867-1935) and its sculptures are attributed to Attilio Piccirilli (1866-1945).<br><br>       Riverside Drive stretches along Riverside Park and the Hudson River from West 72nd Street to Dyckman Street. When New York started expanding northward, the City acquired land in 1866-67 for a park and scenic drive between the Hudson River Railroad and the rocky bluffs along the river. The original 1875 plan, by Frederick Law Olmsted, the co-designer of Central Park, called for a park with a picturesque drive winding along the natural contours of the land. Twenty-five years later, the result was an English-style rustic park and a formal tree-lined boulevard.<br><br>       A fashionable address at the turn of the 20th century, Riverside Drive attracted a collection of substantial neoclassical apartment houses and mansions along its eastern side. The Drive’s majestic elevation also made it an impressive location for colossal monuments and institutions, including Grant’s Tomb (1897) and Riverside Church (1930). The Firemen’s Memorial is one of more than a dozen monuments along Riverside Drive, including sculptures of Franz Sigel (1907), Joan of Arc (1915), Samuel Tilden (1926), Lajos Kossuth (1930), and Eleanor Roosevelt (1996).<br><br>       This monument is said to have had its origins in the remarks of the Right Reverend Henry C. Potter at the funeral of Deputy Fire Chief Charles A. Kruger in 1908. Bishop Potter said that while there were many memorials to public and private citizens there were none &#8220;to our brave citizens who have lost or will sacrifice their lives in a war that never ends.&#8221; Potter was the first chairman of the memorial committee, succeeded by Isidor Straus (1845-1912), a founder of Macy’s department store, who lived at 105th Street and West End Avenue and died on the R.M.S. <i>Titanic</i>. The committee raised $90,500, of which $50,500 was through popular subscription and $40,000 was in public funds allocated by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment on July 17, 1911.<br><br>       Though originally intended for the north end of Union Square, the monument was ultimately built on the hillside facing the Hudson River at 100th Street. The memorial comprises a grand staircase (once flanked by ornamental luminaries), a balustrade plaza, a fountain basin, and the central monument. Made of Knoxville marble, the monument is a sarcophagus-like structure with a massive bas-relief of horses drawing an engine to a fire (the original was replaced by a bronze replica in the 1950s); to the south and north are allegorical sculpture groups representing &#8220;Duty&#8221; and &#8220;Sacrifice,&#8221; for which the celebrated model Audrey Munson (1891-1996) is said to have posed.<br><br>       The architect, Magonigle, also designed the memorial to President McKinley (1843-1901) in Canton, Ohio. Piccirilli, the sculptor, came from a family of master Italian stone carvers who settled in New York City and had a studio in the Bronx. They contributed sculptural and ornamental carving to the Washington Square Arch and the Pulitzer Fountain. Attilio Piccirilli also collaborated with Magonigle on the Maine Monument at Columbus Circle, at the southwest corner of Central Park.<br><br>       The memorial exemplifies a classical grandeur that characterized several civic monuments built in New York City from the 1890s to World War I, as part of an effort dubbed the City Beautiful Movement, which was meant to improve the standard of urban public design and achieve an uplifting union of art and architecture. This monument has twice undergone extensive restoration, once in the late 1930s, through a W.P.A.-sponsored conservation program, and more recently through a $2 million city-funded capital project completed in 1992.<br><br>       The monument was dedicated on September 5, 1913, and was formally accepted on behalf of the city by Mayor William Gaynor (1848-1913), who died later that month. Each autumn, the incumbent mayor joins the fire commissioner and thousands of uniformed firefighters at the Firefighter’s Memorial to honor the memory of firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty. This well-attended ceremony reaffirms the dedication of these public servants, who perform heroic acts on a daily basis.<br><br>       On September 11, 2001 the Fire Department suffered by far its worst loss in a single day, when 343 firefighters died in response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers. Their heroism in the face of death demonstrated extraordinary commitment to the public’s safety, and in the weeks following tragedy, this monument became a vigil site and shrine for those in mourning.<center><br>City of New York Parks & Recreation<br>Michael R.

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Riverside Drive, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>      Located between Riverside Church and International House, Sakura Park owes its name to more than 2000 cherry trees delivered to parks in New York City from Japan in 1912. The word sakura means &#8220;cherry blossom&#8221; in Japanese. The cherry trees were to be presented as a gift from the Committee of Japanese Residents of New York as part of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909.<br><br>       This 18-day celebration, which commemorated the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton’s innovative demonstration of the steam-powered boat on the Hudson River and the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson’s discovery and exploration of that river, took place throughout the state of New York. However, the steamer that carried the original delivery of cherry trees from Japan was lost at sea. A new shipment of trees arrived in New York City in 1912, and they were planted in Riverside and Sakura Parks at that time.<br><br>       Land for Sakura Park was purchased from John D. Rockefeller by the City of New York as an easterly extension of Riverside Park in 1896. Also known as Claremont Park, this land directly east of Grant’s Tomb featured rolling terrain with a curvilinear path system and benches facing the Hudson.

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>       Located between Riverside Church and International House, Sakura Park owes its name to more than 2000 cherry trees delivered to parks in New York City from Japan in 1912. The word sakura means &#8220;cherry blossom&#8221; in Japanese. The cherry trees were to be presented as a gift from the Committee of Japanese Residents of New York as part of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909.<br><br>       This 18-day celebration, which commemorated the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton’s innovative demonstration of the steam-powered boat on the Hudson River and the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson’s discovery and exploration of that river, took place throughout the state of New York. However, the steamer that carried the original delivery of cherry trees from Japan was lost at sea. A new shipment of trees arrived in New York City in 1912, and they were planted in Riverside and Sakura Parks at that time.<br><br>       Land for Sakura Park was purchased from John D. Rockefeller by the City of New York as an easterly extension of Riverside Park in 1896. Also known as Claremont Park, this land directly east of Grant’s Tomb featured rolling terrain with a curvilinear path system and benches facing the Hudson. With a donation from Mr. Rockefeller, the City hired the firm of Olmsted Brothers as landscape architects to redesign the park in 1932.<br><br>       The two year process included grading the site and laying formal paths to create rectangular plots of grass and shrubs, enclosed by hedges and fencing.

On November 25th 1790, known as "Evacuation Day" because it marked the anniversary of the departure of the last British troops from New York in 1783, a group of patriotic citizens met at the Tavern to discuss the defense of their state and nation from possible foreign aggression. As veterans of the Corp of Artillery of the Continental Army, they formed the Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York.

    <desc><![CDATA[Alive-nesses : Proposal for Adaptation is informed by &#8220;dazzle&#8221; painting, an anti-range finding maritime camouflage technique used by the military between 1914 and 1945. The term &#8220;dazzle&#8221; was first used by A.H. Thayer in the book, Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom (1909). There Thayer described natural systems on animal camouflage that break up the biomorphic body, by making it visually indistinguishable from its environment. He referred to these disruptive or high-difference patterns as &#8220;razzle dazzle.&#8221;<br><br>
During the First World War, the military emulated these natural camouflage schemes and applied them to warships. Because of the oblique angles and complex geometric shapes, it was difficult for an enemy looking through a periscope to determine the front of the maritime vessel, as well as its speed and direction. In Alive-nesses, the artist has painted disruptive patterns over the surface of large storage containers at a waterfront location that echoes the original maritime application of this military camouflage technique. The patterns reorganize the perceived form of the containers, disorienting the viewer and formalizing the geometric features of the surrounding buildings and construction.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Reservoir Square was renamed Bryant Park in 1884, in honor of New York’s leading citizen, William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878). In the late 1800s, three philanthropic institutions joined to form the New York Public Library; the building site chosen was the Croton Reservoir. The Beaux-Arts architecture of the library, designed by John Carrere and Thomas Hastings, extended to the redesign of the eastern part of Bryant Park. Using the same Vermont marble as the library building, Hastings included a back terrace and a memorial to Bryant, sculpted by Herbert Adams. The north and south ends of the terrace are defined by twin square structures, designed as comfort stations. Today, the north structure functions as an elegant restroom.<p>
During World War I, Bryant Park was the site of one of the city’s largest public gardens. Planted by the National War Garden Commission and War Garden Committee of Manhattan, these victory gardens sought to involve citizens in food production and boost morale. Around the same time, the park was also home to the Eagle Hut, a facility built and operated by the Y.M.C.A. that provided a home away from home to soldiers and military personnel.<p>
Construction of the Flushing subway line along West 42nd Street closed the north side of Bryant Park for most of the 1920s, leading to a period of neglect for the small urban park. In 1932, it was chosen as the site for the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birth.<p>
The Bicentennial committee built a wood and plaster replica of old Federal Hall, the Wall Street building in which Washington took the oath of office as the first U.S. President. A reenactment of that inauguration was staged there on April 30, 1932.
Responding to an open completion, Queens, NY architect Lusby Simpson submitted a redesign of Bryant Park featuring a classical scheme of a large central lawn, formal pathways, stone balustrades and borers of London Plane trees, together with an oval plaza at the west end containing the existing Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain.<p>
New York City’s powerful Parks Commissioner, Robert Moses, and his staff, including architect Aymar Embury II and landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke, oversaw execution of Simpson’s plan. The park was completed and opened to the public in September 1934. Shortly after, the New York Public Library established and outdoor reading room on the terrace at the eastern end of the park. In good weather, staffers moved stacks and book carts outside for readers to browse.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On West 40th Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Part of Bryant Park’s urbane charm is that it is surrounded by prime examples of several periods of New York City architecture. At the northern corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street is 500 Fifth Avenue. Shreve, Lamb & Harmon (architects of the Empire State Building) designed this 60-story Art Deco tower in 1930. <p>
York & Sawyer designed the former Salmon Tower at 11 West 42nd Street in 1926-27. The famed Guastavino Company produced the tile vaults of the Salmon lobby, and bas-reliefs representing the months of the year adorn the building’s entrance.<p>
Warren & Wetmore (architects of Grand Central Terminal) designed the building at 33 West 42nd Street (1912). Until 1926, the third floor housed Aeolian Hall, site of the premiere of George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue.<p>
Stern’s department store occupied the site to the west from 1913 to 1970. In 1972, George Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the travertine and glass W.R. Grace Building, with its dramatic sloping form.<p>
At the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street is the Home Box Office Building designed in 1985 by Kohn Pedersen Fox. Its neighbor at the northwest corner, the ecologically friendly Bank of America Tower, was designed by Cook + Fox Architects, and completed in 2009. It was the first skyscraper in the world to receive LEED Platinum certification.
The tall, modern building at 1095 Sixth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets was designed by Kahn & Jacobs and built in 1974.<p>
The distinctive building at the southeast corner of Sixth Avenue and 40th Street is known as the Bryant Park Studio Building. Charles Alonzo Rich designed the Beaux-Arts style building in 1900-01 to house artists’ studios, including those of photographer Edward Steichen and the painter Fernand Leger.
Continuing east on 40th Street, York & Sawyer designed 54 West 40th Street as the Republican Club.
Raymond Hood and J. Andre Fouilhoux designed the block’s most prominent edifice, the American Radiator Building, in 1923-24. Now the Bryant Park Hotel, this romantic tower of dark brick is topped with gold, so that when illuminated at night the building resembles a glowing radiator coil. (Hood later directed the team of architects that designed Rockefeller Center.)
Andrew Carnegie commissioned the architects Whitfield & King to design 32 W 40th Street as the Engineers’ Club in 1906. John Hemenway Duncan (architect of Grant’s Tomb) designed the lovely Knox Hat Building at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 40th Street. Erected in 1901-02, it housed the head office of one of the country’s great men’s hat brands. Attia & Perkins in 1981-83 designed the office tower (now home to HSBC) preserving the Knox Hat Building shell.
The most recognizable building overlooking the park is the New York Public Library (1898-1911). The design is by Thomas Hastings and John Merven Arrere in collaboration with the first director of the Library, John Shaw Billings. The stone &#8220;stripes&#8221; on the library’s rear facade indicate the original book stacks, and behind the top floor arcade is the Main Reading Room.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Bryant Park Today]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near West 40th Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[In 1974, the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Bryant Park a Scenic Landmark, call it &#8220;...a prime example of a park designed in the French Classical tradition...an urban amenity worthy of our civic pride.: Within five years of this declaration, park attendance decreased and criminal activity increased, with over 150 reported robberies each year. Mounting concern about crime, drug-trading, and vandalism, from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the New York Public Library, New York City officials, and concerned citizens, led to a commissioned report by urbanist William H. &#8220;Holly&#8221; Whyte. Whyte wrote of Bryant Park: &#8220;If you went out and hired the dope dealers, you couldn’t get a more villainous crew to show the urgency of the [present Bryant Park] situation.&#8221;
<p>Soon after, on January 1, 1980, the Bryant Park Corporation (BPC) &#8211; then called Bryant Park Restoration Corporation &#8211; was founded, with the aim to restore, program, and operate the park. The fledgling not-for-profit organization was led by Daniel A. Berderman, a young Harvard Business School graduate, and Andrew Heiskell, the Chairman of Time, Inc. and the New York Public Library.<p>
BPC undertook a massive cleaning effort and deployed additional maintenance staff throughout the park. Graffiti was removed, free public events were staged, and in areas formerly occupied by drug-sellers, the Parks Council installed temporary vendor kiosks for books and flowers, and BPC installed a half-price tickets booth. Attracted by these improvements, some park visitors returned, and soon after BPC unveiled a master plan to radically renovate Bryant Park. Drafted in 1980, the plan focused on long-term, funding and management of the park, and also provided for an improved lawn, two full-service restaurants, gravel paths, major capital repairs, improved lighting, and a meticulous restoration of the park’s restrooms and monuments.<p>
With support from the Mayor’s Office and the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, the management and operational duties were transferred over to the BPC, making it the first publicly-owned park in the United States to become fully privately managed. Bierderman, aided first by NYPL Chairman and several major property-owners, created a business improvement district, the Bryant Park Management Corporation, which united the park’s abutting property-owners to assure an initial income stream for maintenance, and a source of credit for the development of revenue-producing facilities.<p>
On March 1, 1988 BPC assumed day-to-day management of the park, and construction began on a massive renovation. That summer, city agencies approved BPC’s landscape plans (drafted by Hanna/Olin Ltd.) to build new entrances for increased visibility from the street, enhance the formal French garden design, and improve and repair paths and lighting. BPC’s plan included restoration of the park’s monuments, and an elaborate renovation of its long-closed restrooms. The city also approved BPC’s designs (by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates) for two restaurant pavilions and four concession kiosks, which were to generate off-peak activity and add revenue for operations.<p>
In all, BPC raised $18 million for the park renovation from private donations, a bank loan, risk capital from park concessionaires, and the city.
To provide operating money for the park’s private sanitation and security forces, and horticultural maintenance, the company combined several new revenue streams. These included rental fees from commercial events, concession revenues, corporate sponsorships, and BID revenues.<p>
Bryant Park reopened in April 1992 to lavish praise from citizens and visitors, the media, and urbanists. As noted in an Urban Land Institute award citation, &#8220;the success of the park feeds the success of the neighborhood.&#8221; Soon the chorus was joined by the business community, whose assessments helped fund the renewal, and who now benefit from much higher property values.<p>
The redesign brought not only significant physical changes in the parks design, but free music, dance, and children’s programming, classes, and concessions. Year-around amenities added since 1992 including a full-service bar and restaurant (1995), four food kiosks (1992), free wi-fi internet access (2002), a custom-built carousel (2002), and a custom furnished lounge-like deck accented with exotic plants (2009).
Seasonal amenities include the Holiday Shops (2002), the Reading Room (2003), a winter ice skating rink (2005), and ping pong (2009). In the spring and summer, BPC offers over 500 free classes including yoga, knitting, and fencing. Other activities include birding tours, petanque and chess tournaments, free concerts, and book talks in the Reading Room. The start of the park’s busy summer season is marked by the return of the HBO Bryant Park Summer Film Festival, a weekly event that draws thousands of visitors to the park to enjoy outdoor screenings of classic films. BPC continues to add new programs, events, and amenities, as well as adjust older favorites to cater to an ever-growing and diverse population. By paying careful attention to detail, service quality, and visitor feedback, BPC has increased its visitor count from almost zero in the late 1970s to six million people per year.

    <name><![CDATA[Monuments in Bryant Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near West 42nd Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[(18) The William Cullen Bryant Memorial, a tribute, like the name of the park itself, to one of the most important New Yorkers of the nineteenth century, is a bronze by Herbert Adams &#8211; one of the best New York sculptors of his period. Thomas Hastings, an architect of the New York Public Library, designed the marble setting. Bryant (1794-1878) was a poet, newspaper owner and editor, and a civic reformer. <p>
(17) The bronze of the American writer Gertrude Stein (1874-1946), just to the west of the Bryant Memorial, was created in 1923 by the New York-born sculptor, Jo Davidson. Donated to the park in 1992, the statue is a cast made from the original, which is now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.<p>
(16) On the south side of the park is a bronze bust of the great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), by Karl Fischer, who created the bust in the year Goethe died. The Goethe Club of New York purchased it in 1876 and donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art &#8211; which in turn donated it to Bryant Park in 1932, the centennial of the writer’s death.<p>
(19) Master sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward’s bronze statue of William Earle Dodge (1805-83) on the north side of the park, was one of the first in the city to honor a local citizen. Dodge was a businessman (Phelps, Dodge & Co., Native American rights activist, and philanthropist, who helped found the Y.M.C.A. in America. Originally dedicated in Herald Square on October 22, 1885, the statue was moved here in 1941.<p>
(15) Dedicated in 1912, the pink granite Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain by Charles Adams Platt, an authority on Italian Renaissance gardens and fountains, was the city’s first public memorial to a woman. Social worker Lowell (1843-1905) founded the Charity Organization Society in 1882.<p>
(21) Overlooking Avenue of the Americas is a bronze statue of José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva (1763-1838), by José Otávio Correia Lima. Dedicated in 1955, the statue was a gift from the people of Brazil when Sixth Avenue was renamed and conceived in the spirit of pan-American cooperation. Andrada, a leader in the Brazilian fight for independence from Portugal, became Brazil’s first prime minister.
(20) Just to the north of Andrada, also on the Avenue of the Americas, is bronze statue of Benito Juárez (1806-1872), by Moises Cabrera Orozco. Juárez, a beloved Mexican President, is the first Mexican to be commemorated with a city monument. The statue was a gift from the Mexican State of Oaxaca to the City of New York and was dedicated on October 9, 2004.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Jefferson Market Garden]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Greenwich Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Where some went to market, and some went to jail, today’s Greenwich Villagers tend the Jefferson Market Garden in the shade of the landmark Market Courthouse.<p>
Named for Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, the Jefferson Market opened on this site in 1833, alongside a police court, a volunteer firehouse, and a jail. The market grew rapidly to include fishmongers, poultry vendors, and hucksters. It was razed in 1873 to make way for a new civic complex and courthouse.<p>
The Jefferson Market Courthouse, with its fire-watch bell tower, and lighted clock dial, was designed by Fredrick Clarke Withers and Calvert Vaux, and built in 1877. The ornate courthouse struck the New York Times as inappropriate for such a shoddy neighborhood &#8211; &#8220;a jewel in a pig’s snout.&#8221; Nonetheless, architects polled in 1895 deemed the building to be the fifth most beautiful in the United States. While Vaux believed that the cells should be &#8220;strong, secure and entirely unattractive,: he created a six-tiered structure that allowed some light to penetrate and air to circulate. At the turn of the century, the triangular parcel between Sixth Avenue, Greenwich Avenue, and 10th Street was thus entirely occupied and connected to the rest of the city by the Gilbert Elevated Railway’s Sixth Avenue line, inaugurated in 1878.<p>
In 1927 the jail, the market and the firehouse were demolished and replaced by the City’s only House of Detention for Women, an 11-story building designated in the French Art Deco style by Benjamin W. Levitan. By the time the Women’s House of Detention opened in 1931, the adjacent courthouse heard only cases with female defendants. Correction Commissioner Richard Patterson introduced the facility as &#8220;undoubtedly the best institution of its kind in the United States if not indeed the entire world.&#8221; Contemporaries noted the facility’s modern equipment, one of the most striking features being a turntable altar in the chapel, with sections fitted respectively for Protestant, Catholic,, and Jewish services.
Use of public transportation declined during the Depression, and the clattering elevated railways were criticized for lowering property values. The 6th Avenue line was demolished in 1939. Amendments to the district court system in 1945 led to the abandonment of the courthouse, which was to be sold by auction in 1959, The Greenwich Village Association (GVA), led by Margot Gayle and Verna Small, campaigned forcefully to preserve the building, and won their first victory in 1961 by saving the four-sided clock in the tower. A year later Mayor Wagner agreed to establish a Village branch of the New York Public Library in the Jefferson Market Courthouse.<p>
The Board of Estimate transferred the site to Parks in 1974, and the Jefferson Market Garden Committee, Inc., composed of Village neighborhood associations and homeowners, was entrusted with its care. Landscape architect Pamela Berdan originally designed the garden in the spirit of Frederick Law Olmsted, who co-designed Central and Prospect Parks with Calvert Vaux. The garden was planted with 10 Star and Saucer Magnolia trees, 7 Yoshino Cherry trees, 2 American Yellowwoods, 7 Thornless Honey locusts, 10 Crabapple trees, 70 fairy hedge roses around the lawn, 60 pycarantha, and 56 holly bushes in clusters. Volunteers have since planted tulips, daffodils, and crocuses in garden.<p>
In the late 1960s, GVA and Community Board 2 held town meetings to discuss the removal of the Women’s House of Detention and the creation of a &#8220;passive recreation area&#8221; on the site. At the time, friends and families of inmates lingered outside the House at all hours of the day or night, yelling their news and greetings. Nearby residents were disturbed by the noise. Gawkers came to watch the scene. The facility was overcrowded and had become obsolete. The Women’s House of Detention was demolished in 1973, after 42 years of use.<p>
A generous grant, one of the last made by the Vincent Astor Foundation, funded the new decorative steel fence, which recalls the design of the courthouse fence and unifies the site. On October 13, 1998 Mrs. Brook Astor dedicated the fence at a ceremony attended by members of the Greenwich Village community.]]></desc>

In the 1920’s, when the brewery became the Cherry Lane Theater, this house was part of an artist and writer community that included the houses on the south side of Commerce St. to the theater and the west side of Bedford St. through No. 73. These houses shared a rear courtyard while heat and hot water were piped from a furnace located at No. 34. Today, this house has its own small garden surrounded by the theater’s backstage buildings. The stoop, removed by McLachlan after the house’s construction, was replaced in 1996. The house retains its handsome wood roof cornice, typical of the houses of the Greek Revival period.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><i>Wavertree</i> was built at Southampton, England in 1885 for R.W. Leyland & Company of Liverpool. She was first employed to carry jute, used in making rope and burlap bags, between eastern India (now Bangladesh) and Scotland. When less than two years old she entered the tramp trades, taking cargoes anywhere in the world she could find them. After sailing for a quarter century, she limped into the Falkland Islands in December 1910, having been almost totally dismasted in a gale off Cape Horn. Rather than re-rigging her, her owners sold her for use as a floating warehouse at Punta Arenas, Chile. She was converted into a sand barge at Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1947, and acquired there by the South Street Seaport Museum in 1968 for eventual restoration to her appearance as a sailing vessel.<br><br>
By the time <i>Wavertree</i> was built, she was nearly obsolete. Steam engines suitable for efficiently propelling ships across the ocean had been introduced in the 1870s and were being used on nearly all the shorter trade routes. While this was taking place, iron &#8211; long the choice of ship builders in iron producing countries, such as England &#8211; was giving way to steel. <i>Wavertree</i> was one of the last large sailing ships built of wrought iron. She is today the largest afloat.<br><br>
Most countries stopped building large sailing ships altogether in the first decade of this century. The last cargo-carrying sailing ship was launched in Germany in 1926. The last two to round Cape Horn with cargoes did so in 1949, carrying grain from Australia to Europe.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>In commemoration of the 10th Anniversary of 9/11/01, the Milstein Family and Emigrant Bank have dedicated this site to display &#8220;The Kneeling Fireman&#8221; statue which harkens back to the events of that fateful day. <br><br>
The statue was originally commissioned by the Firefighters Association of Missouri and was custom manufactured by Matthews International Corp. in Parma, Italy. The statue arrived in New York just as the tragedy began to unfold. Matthews International decided this statue should never leave the city and presented it to the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation, who accepted the gift on behalf of all the firefighters and citizens of New York City. The Milstein Family agreed to display the statue and provided a granite base and storage until a fitting permanent site could be found. <br><br>
&#8220;The Kneeling Fireman&#8221; was temporarily displayed in front of one of the Milstein buildings at 44th Street and 8th Avenue. <br><br>
With the dedication of this site in front of the Emigrant Bank building, the statue has found a permanent home and represents the only memorial to 9/11 in midtown Manhattan. <br><br>
Emigrant Bank was founded in 1850 by Irish immigrants and many of the early depositors worked in the uniformed services, including a large number as firefighters. <br><br>
Howard P. Milstein, Chief Executive Officer of Emigrant Bank serves on the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Board and has funded sculptures made from the original steel of the World Trade Center for each of the victims’ families. He also funded the recent publication of &#8220;Art of Heart: Remembering 9/11&#8221;, a book of children’s pictures dedicated to the victims’ families. <br><br>
The Milstein Family was one of the builders of the World Trade Center, including all walls, floors, and ceilings. During the attack, Milstein employees evacuated residents of Battery Park City buildings by water. For more than a year, Milstein Personnel and resources supported the relief effort by providing food and housing. <br><br>
Among those lost on that day was Neil David Levin, Director of the Port Authority, and close personal friend of Howard P. Milstein, as well as daughters of colleagues at Emigrant Bank and Milstein Properties, Lindsay Stapleton Morehouse and Stacey Leigh Sanders. <b>May They Rest in Peace</b>.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Fashion Walk of Fame celebrates excellence in American design by honoring the New York designers who have had a significant and lasting impact on the way the world dresses.<p>
New York has been the undisputed center of American fashion since the mid-19th Century when the development of mass-production led to growth of the apparel trades. The birth of the Fashion District, also known as the Garment Center, occurred in the 1920s, when a large group of garment manufactures relocated to Seventh Avenue. New loft space was developed especially to accommodate &#8220;modern&#8221; manufacturing and to satisfy labor’s demands for safer working conditions. By 1931, this District has the largest concentration of apparel manufactures in the world and since then has been home to the greatest names in American design.<p>

    <name><![CDATA[How the Bridge was Built]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Brooklyn Bridge, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Considered one of the greatest triumphs of nineteenth-century engineering when it opened in May, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was built to provide a suitable all-weather link between the then independent and rapidly growing cities of New York and Brooklyn. The brilliant engineer John Roebling proposed a great suspension bridge, a pioneering structure in its use of steel which would leave the busy East River free of obstruction. When he died in an accident as the bridge was being surveyed, his son Washington was chosen to complete the structure. <p>
Washington was totally disabled in 1872 by caisson disease (the bends) and could never visit the site again. His remarkable wife Emily became his chief administrative aide and enabled Washington to finish the project successfully.<p>

<b>1870 The Bridge Foundation</b><br>
The majestic towers of the bridge rest on wooden foundations called pneumatic caissons. Each caisson is a giant bottomless chamber which was built on land and slowly sunk to the river bed exactly where the tower was to rise. Inside the chamber, workers excavated debris until firm ground to support the weight of the tower was reached. The caisson was then filled with concrete.<p><b>
1870 The Tower’s Begun</b><br>
The stone blocks for the towers were lifted into place by boom derricks and a system of steam pulleys. The weight of the first stone course for the tower caused the caisson to settle to the river bed; the excavation began.<p><b>
1871 Work in the Caisson</b><br>
Within each caisson was an elaborate system of air locks and supply shafts. Compressed air was pumped in to keep the river water out. Workers entered the caisson through air locks. Debris was removed through shafts filled with water and carried from the site on scows. Many men fell ill to the bends caused by rapid changes in pressure when leaving the caisson.<p><b>
1872 The Towers Rise</b><br>
The towers support the cables and thereby the entire weight of the bridge roadway and traffic. They are constructed of New Jersey limestone and Maine granite, and each rises 272 feet and 6 inches above high water. In 1872 the towers reached the height of the roadway.<p><b>
1876 The Towers are Joined</b><br>
Massive stone anchorages on either shore secure the cables and resist their tremendous pull. Each anchorage weighs 60,000 tons and is 89 feet high. Before cable making could begin, the towers were joined by wire rope loops, called &#8220;travelers:&#8221; these would carry men and material between the anchorages. The first traveler was completed August 14, 1876.<p><b>
August 1876 Frank Farrington</b><br>
Master-Mechanic Franck Farrington is first to cross East River by a traveler wire.<p><b>
1877 Preparation for Cable Spinning</b><br>
All the work on the bridge was done without disturbing traffic in the busy port. When the towers were completed, cable spinning began. Work platforms were supported on wires high above the river and were reached by walkways that ran from anchorage to anchorage over the tops of the towers.<p><b>
1877 The Carrier Wheels</b><br>
For the cable spinning wire was looped around a carrier wheel hung from the traveler and pulled across the river from Brooklyn to New York. The system, driven by steam engines, worked like a conveyor belt. Over 14,000 miles of wire were used in the cables.<p><b>
1877 Cable Spinning</b><br>
As the wires for the cables were spun in place, workers adjusted them to exact position and make sure all were parallel. When 278 wires were spun, they were bound to form a strand. Nineteen strands formed one cable. The cable stands were bolted to eyebar chains encased in the masonry of the anchorage. An iron anchor plate holds the end of each chain in place.<br>
Each anchor plate weights 23 tons. Eighteen eyebars radiate up from it’s base<br>
Section of cable 15 ¾ inches thick. 19 strands per cable.<p><b>
1878 Cable Wrapping</b><br>
John Roebling designed the unique machine used to wrap the cables of the bridge. An iron clamp compressed the strands, forming a cable into a perfect cylindrical arrangement. A wrapping device bound the cable with a tight spiral of soft wire and the cable was then coated with white lead. This process stiffened the cables and protected them from weather.<p><b>
1881 Suspending the Roadway</b><br>
The bridge floor is made of steel trusses suspended from the cables by wire rope. At midspan the roadway is 135 feet above the water and allows easy passage of river traffic.<p>
May 24, 1883 A Union of Hears and a Union of Hands
Finis Coronat Opus. &#8220;The finish crowns the work&#8221; commemorates the opening of the bridge linking the cities of New York and Brooklyn in 1883. After thirteen years of innovative and courageous effort the exultation was appropriate. In the years following the Civil War this image of success must have been especially poignant and expressive of both spiritual recovery and technological growth. The two cities clasping hands suggests the final consolidation of New York and Brooklyn with other boroughs in 1898.<p>

    <desc><![CDATA[People looking south towards Brooklyn from bridge in 1883 were treated to a spectacular view. 135 feet below them dozens of ferries, looking like toy boats, crisscrossed the East River, taking passengers to and from Manhattan. Along the busy waterfront the chimneys of factories and distilleries spouted great clouds of smoke as clipper ships and steamers sailed into the harbor, bound for the warehouses and docks that lined Brooklyn’s shore. Rising above the horizon in the distance were the steeples of Brooklyn’s many churches. Most were built in the nineteenth century when clever speculators offered land to congregations at no cost. Once a church was built, the lots around it were usually quickly sold off and developed for residential use. Because of its many ecclesiastic structures, Brooklyn was known as &#8220;the city of churches.&#8221; <p>Brooklyn’s city seal, which dates from 1834, depicts the Goddess Vesta and bears the motto &#8220;Eendraght Maakt Magt&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;In Union There is Strenght.&#8221;
<p><b>Crossing the Bridge<br>
1883</b> &#8211; Cable cars are installed on the Brooklyn Bridge, running on both sides of the promenade next to the roadway.<p><b>
1898</b> &#8211; Electric trolleys come into service on the bridge. Electric trains of the Brooklyn Elevated Company are also introduced, replacing the cable cars except during rush hours when both kinds of trains are run on the same tracks.<p><b>
1952</b> &#8211; The bridge re-opens after extensive remodeling and accommodates only vehicular traffic. Cable cars were removed from the bridge in 1908. Elevated trains discontinued service in 1944, and trolleys made their last run in 1950.<p><b>
United States Navy Yard</b><br>
The U.S. Navy Yard was established in 1801 on the site of a small local shipyard. Over the years it was expanded to 291 acres, comprising six dry docks, many miles of railroad tracks, lumber yards, warehouses, a hospital and officer’s housing. Ninety-three ships were built at the Navy Yard and several hundreds were refitted for battle in the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Some of the important ships launched at the Navy Yard were the &#8220;Ohio&#8221; (1820), the &#8220;Maine&#8221; (1890), and the &#8220;Missouri&#8221; (1944). The &#8220;Duluth,&#8221; the last ship to be built at the Navy Yard, was launched in 1965, a year before the Navy Yard closed.<p>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Completed in 1907, the West Street Building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert as a premier office skyscraper for the shipping and railroad industries. The building combines the classical tripartite configuration of base, shaft and capital, common on late nineteenth-century office buildings, with the twentieth&#8211;century romantic emphasis on verticality and decorative crowns. With its clustered piers, terra cotta cladding, and gothic detail, including griffin figures and a foliate cornice with gargoyles, the West Street Building serves as a precursor to Gilbert’s masterpiece, the Woolworth Building. On September 11th, 2001, the West Street Building was severely damaged by fire and falling debris from the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers. After extensive repairs, the building re-opened in 2005 as a residential apartment building. <br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The new Governors Island landfill was only just complete &#8211; a largely empty dust blown expanse of over 100 acres &#8211; when it gained fame for its role in the budding aviation industry. In 1909, the Hudson-Fulton Celebration took place to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson’s voyage up the Hudson River. It also celebrated the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton’s innovative paddle wheel steamer which traveled from New York City to Albany, ushering in the era of steamship travel. A series of demonstration flights were planned as part of the celebration. Wilbur Wright was paid to make a number of flights and was promised a $15,000 prize for a flight of over ten miles. Wright flew from Governors Island around the Statue of Liberty and back. The flight, though not long enough to win the prize, is considered the first successful flight over water in America. Days later, Wright succeeded in flying over ten miles from the Island up the Hudson, around Grant’s Tomb and back.<br><br>During World War I, the Island’s use in flight diminished. The flat expanse of the south island was filled with support structures for the war effort, including the &#8220;World’s Shortest Railroad.&#8221; The one mile long track allowed supplies to be carried from the piers to workshops and warehouses across the south island.<br><br>In the 1920s, New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia advocated the use of this open, flat land as a municipal airport. A heated conflict emerged as the Army held fast to its original vision of an expanded army post, and stalled the idea of the airport. Ongoing debates continued for two decades, until progress in the aviation industry rendered the site inadequate. Instead, a new city airport, La Guardia, was opened in Queens in 1939.<br><br>The monument erected here honors the pioneers of solo flight, nicknamed &#8220;The Early Birds,&#8221; including the Wright Brothers, Glen Curtiss and Ruth Law. Dedicated in 1954, the monument features a bronze cast of the propeller from Wilbur Wright’s first military flight in 1909.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>On Wall Street, between Pearl and Water Streets, a market that auctioned enslaved people of African ancestry was established by a Common Council law on November 30, 1711. This slave market was in use until 1762. Slave owners wanting to hire out their enslaved workers, which included people of Native American ancestry, as day laborers also had to do so at this location. In 1726 the structure was renamed the Meal Market because corn, grain and meal &#8211; crucial ingredients to the Colonial diet &#8211; were also exclusively traded there.<br><br>Slavery was introduced to Manhattan in 1626. By the mid-18th century approximately one in five people living in New York City was enslaved and almost half of Manhattan households included at least one slave. Although New York State abolished slavery in 1827, complete abolition came only in 1841 when the State of New York abolished the rights of non-residents to have slaves in the state for up to nine months. However, the use of slave labor elsewhere for the production of raw materials such as sugar and cotton was essential to the economy of New York both before and after the Civil War. Slaves also cleared forest land for the construction of Broadway and were among the workers that built the wall that Wall Street is named for and helped build the first Trinity Church. Within months of the market’s construction, New York’s first slave uprising occurred a few blocks away on Maiden Lane, led by enslaved people from Coromantee and Pawpaw people of Ghana.]]></desc>

Later a garage and now the Gabarron Foundation Carriage House Center for the Arts, the building serves as a reminder of a time when stables were an important part of daily city life.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 12 Avenue (Pier 86), New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Initially flown in 1962, Blackbird performed sensitive reconnaissance missions while flying at speeds over Mach 3. The aircraft was the creation of Lockheed’s famous &#8220;Skunk Works&#8221; division, headed by Clarence &#8220;Kelly&#8221; Johnson. Single-seat Blackbirds flew at altitudes up to 100,000 feet (30.480 meters). Its top recorded speed was 2,269 mph (3,651 kph). Fewer than 50 were built. The early A-12s were used by CIA surveillance missions for the Air Force and NASA.<p>
This A-12 was the first production unit. It served as a radar-test example early in 1962 at the secret base Area 51. A special radar signature-lowering paint covered its mostly titanium airframe, which incorporated carbon fiber composites. Two massive Pratt and Whitney J-58 turbo-ramjets each with 32,000 pounds of trust were used only in the Blackbird. The adjacent starter cart uses two Buick 401 cubic-inch Wildcat powerplants of 350 horsepower each, engines akin to the V-8 engines of American &#8220;muscle cars&#8221; of the era.<p>
This aircraft and its starter cart are on loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force. 
Did you know that the A-12 Blackbird was equipped with high-power cameras whose photos, taken from 80,000 feet, revealed such details as cars, roads, and individual trees?]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The F-14 Tomcat was the Navy’s first-line fighter from 1972-2006. In full forward-sweep position, its distinctive variable-geometry wings provide the lift needed to slow-speed flight essential for carrier landings. In swept-back position, the wings blend into the aircraft, giving the F-14 Tomcat a dart-like silhouette for supersonic flight at speeds up to 1,544 mph (2,485 kmp) and heights more than 50,000 feet (15,239 meters). Powerful on-board targeting systems allow a Tomcat’s two-seat crew of pilot and radar intercept officer to simultaneously fire up to six Phoenix missiles at six different targets at ranges exceeding 100 miles (161 km)! For close-in action, F-14;s typically carry shorter-ranged Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles in addition to a 20mm M61 cannon.<p>
This aircraft on display, 157986, was the seventh Tomcat built by Grumman and was retained as their primary research and development airframe. In 1973, it served as the prototype for the &#8220;Super Tomcat&#8221; series, which incorporated more powerful engines. The Tomcat is on loan from the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida.<p>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 12 Avenue (Pier 86), New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The design of the single-seat Tiger incorporated the Area Rule to reduce transonic and super-sonic drag. Its Coke bottle-shaped fuselage was narrower at the wings and tail, a concept developed by Richard Whitcomb of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Tiger featured a thin wing, fuselage-side intakes, a low-mounted tailplane, and an afterburning engine. The latter enabled the F11F to fly at 753 mph (1,112 kph). Tigers could reach altitudes of 42,000 feet (12,800 meters).<p>
The Tiger production line was short-lived, with only 201 planes built from 1957-1958. The first 42 Tigers were produced with a short nose, while later planes like the one displayed here had a long nose. Squadron VF-33 flew Tigers off the Intrepid from 1958 through 1960.<p>
The Blue Angels, the U.S. Navy’s flight demonstration team, flew Tigers from 1957-68. This plane served as Blue Angel 5 during the early 1960s. It is on loan from the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida.<p>
Did you know that during the test flight in September 1956, an F-11Tiger pilot crossed paths with his own cannon rounds during a dive, damaging the plane? The pilot survived in a crash landing.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near East Drive, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This path marks the route of the Kingsbridge Road, also known as the Eastern Post Road. This was the main road through Manhattan in the 1700s and early 1800s, before the current street grid was implemented, and was key to transportation in the area. Originally the route of a Native American trail known as the Wickqueasgeck Trail, the road was designated a public highway in 1669. The road originated in southern Manhattan at around today's Madison Square and proceeded north to the King's Bridge at the northern tip of Manhattan. Upon entering the Bronx, the road split, with one branch leading to Albany and the other to Boston. As these were the main roads for mail delivery and travel, they were known as post roads, and are considered the first public highways.<p>

The Kingsbridge Road entered the future Central Park at around 95th Street and veered west to find a suitable place to cross the Harlem Creek, which flowed east into the Harlem River. The road passed through this rocky landscape and descended through McGowan's Pass, named after the McGowan family, who owned a house and tavern near the present-day site of the Park's operational area known as the Mount. The Pass, together with commanding views north from high points in the landscape, made this a highly strategic location for military defense. The British army built fortifications in this area during the Revolutionary War, and a few decades later the American army rebuilt fortifications in some of the same locations during the War of 1812. As part of this latter effort, the Americans built a gatehouse to control access to the road and defend against a British attack from the north. In the course of restoring this landscape in 2013, the Central park Conservancy hired archaeologists to determine the impact of the project on any physical remnants of this history. The archeologists discovered the foundations of the gatehouse as well as the surface of the Kingsbridge Road, still preserved underground. These are significant findings that help us understand the history of the landscape before the park was built.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>           This unique monument is a traditional Japanese stone lantern, dedicated in Sakura Park on October 2, 1960.<br><br>           The monument was a gift of international friendship, and its inscription (now worn away) read, &#8220;Presented by the citizens of the Metropolis of Tokyo to the citizens of the City of New York in celebration of the Tokyo-New York sister-city affiliation inaugurated on February 29, 1960&#8221;.<br><br>           The Japanese stone lantern, or ishi toro, was traditionally used for illumination at Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. During the Momoyama period (1573-1615), the sculptural form was adapted for decorative use in tea gardens or roji. Granite or syenite was the material most often used. The size and proportion varied depending on its placement in the garden, and a number of diverse styles evolved. Over time, their function as a housing for oil or candles gave way to a decorative purpose.<br><br>           The lantern in Sakura Park is an example of the style known as kasuga-toro, and includes a stylized lotus flower at the base of the capital, reliefs of imaginary animals, and a capstone with six volutes. The style originated in the province of Kasuga; this particular example was built and carved by skilled Japanese artisans in 1930. Its total height is more than 14 feet, and it weighs close to seven tons. It was delivered to the United States aboard the maritime training vessel Nippon Maru. Another Japanese toro may be seen locally at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.<br><br>           The dedication ceremony was attended by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko, as well as 1,500 onlookers. In October 1987, Akihiti, now Emperor, returned with the princess, and participated in a ceremony at the lantern attended by Mayor Edward I. Koch, Commissioner Stern, and Gordon Evans, president of International House, built in 1924. The adjacent multi-story residence and cultural center serves numerous foreign and American students attending institutions of higher learning in the metropolitan region.<br><br>           Sakura Park derives its name from the Japanese word for cherry tree. In 1912, Parks received a consignment of two thousand cherry trees from Japan, many of which were planted in the vicinity of Riverside Park. Today, both landscape and monument represent the enduring and flowering exchange between the American and Japanese people.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near 5th Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[With its high ground and expansive views to the north and east, it is clear why this spot was regarded as an important strategic position in two wars. In 1776, the British built a fortification here, following its invasion of Manhattan, as part of a defensive line extending west to the Hudson River. During the War of 1812, the American military rebuilt a fort in this location and named it Fort Clinton, in honor of Mayor DeWitt Clinton, then mayor of New York. In the 1860s, the designers of Central Park recognized the scenic and historic value of this location, and retained the remains of the fortification. They developed the site as a scenic overlook incorporating rustic fencing, benches, and a flagpole. The Central park Conservancy rebuilt the overlook in 2014, recreating some of these historic details and restoring the surrounding landscape.<p>
The recent project by the Conservancy also involved reinstalling two cannons that had been in storage since the 1970s. The cannons have a rather curious history: they were never actually fired from this location. Recent research has confirmed that they originated on the Hussar, a British Royal Navy ship that ran aground on Hell gate in the East River in 1780 while delivering supplies for the Revolutionary War. The cannons were donated to the park in 1865 and put in display in a museum in the former convent of Mount Saint Vincent, just south of this location. After the building was destroyed by fire in 1881, the cannons were unaccounted for until 1905, when Edward Hagaman Hall, a historian and preservationist, discovered them lying on the ground near Fort Clinton. Given the military history of the area, he assumed they were period artifacts and advocated to have them installed in this location. In 1906 the Parks Department installed the cannons at Fort Clinton on a granite base. In 2014 the Conservancy conserved the cannons and the base and returned them to this location.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 5th Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Long before the construction of Central Park, the rock bluffs in the landscape just south of the Haarlem Meer played an important part in our city's - and nation's - history. Both British and American recognized these hills as a key strategic location during the Revolutionary War. They provided expansive views to the north and proximity to the Kingsbridge Road, the main road through Manhattan during the 1700s and early 1800s. In 1776, following the withdrawal of American forces to northern Manhattan, the British army constructed fortifications in this landscape, as part of a line of defenses extending to the west, and they built encampments and barracks for British and Hessian troops. For the duration of the war, there were typically around 500 soldiers stationed in the area. In 1782, fears of an American offensive prompted a buildup of troops, and there were as many as 10,000 troops encamped in the area.<p>
During the War of 1812, the American army recognized the area as key to defending the city from a British invasion. In 1814, military engineers built on top of earlier fortifications, creating a defenses system that included three fortifications. Named Fort Fish, Fort Clinton and Nutter's Battery, they were linked by low earthen walls and a gatehouse to control access to the Kingsbridge Road. They also constructed additional defenses on the hills to the west, including the structure know as the Blockhouse that still remains in the park.<p>
The designers of Central Park retained the remnants of the fortifications in their development of this portion of the park, which was completed in 1867, and created an overlook at the location of Fort Clinton. In 1945 the Parks Department added new paths to the area, redeveloped Fort Clinton, and created a scenic overlook at Nutter's Battery. While the original fortifications have eroded over time, traces remain, and the expansive views of the surrounding landscape and the city are still part of the experience.<p>
The area continues to be known as the Fort Landscape, and the names of the War of 1812 fortifications are still in use. Between 2014 and 2014, the Central Park Conservancy restored this landscape, including the reconstruction of the overlooks at Fort Clinton and Nutter's Battery. The work included historical research and archeological investigations that revealed new information and physical remnants of area's past, providing insights in the military events that unfolded here and a window into the pre-urban landscape of New York.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Hamilton Fountain]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Riverside Drive, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This ornate, baroque-styled marble fountain is named for Robert Ray Hamilton (1851-1890) a prominent businessman, land owner and politician who bequeathed $9,000 to the City for its creation and installation. It is one of the finest and last surviving examples of the decorative horse troughs that once dotted the cityscape.
<br><br>
Hamilton, a great-grandson of statesman Alexander Hamilton, was educated at Columbia Grammar School, College, and Law School. He owed his wealth to properties he owned on the west side of Manhattan, as well as an inheritance that yielded him an annual income of $40,000&#8212;a sizable sum at the time. Though defeated when he ran in 1879 for a seat on the Board of Alderman, the following year he was elected to the State Assembly, from the Eleventh District, subsequently defeated and then reelected to several terms from 1885 to 1889. Not long before his death in a hunting accident, he was involved in a public scandal involving Eva Mann, whom he had secretly married, and who had used this alliance to raid his substantial financial holdings.
<br><br>
After Hamilton’s death, executors of his estate and the City retained the esteemed architectural firm of Warren & Wetmore&#8212;whose more notable buildings include Grand Central Terminal, Chelsea Piers, and the Con Edison Tower&#8212;to design the fountain. An initial rendering, more limited in scope, was rejected by the City’s Art Commission, before the present design with its central eagle feature was approved and realized.
<br><br>
Crafted from Tennessee marble, the lavishly carved fountain, composed of separate masonry units, is surmounted by an eagle with wings spread, beneath which are decorative motifs, a coat of arms, a dolphins’ head spray feature, a shell-shaped spill basin, and a larger foliate catch basin. There is an upward-facing incised commemorative inscription, worn by time, on the front perimeter of the basin. The fountain stands at the center of a sidewalk plaza and is inserted into the 19th-century rustic retaining wall of the earliest portions of Riverside Park.
<br><br>
Created for &#8220;man and beast,&#8221; the fountain was evidently intended primarily as a drinking fountain for horses, and was erected during an era when the streets of Manhattan were frequented by thousands of horses on a daily basis, and equine transport was the principal means of conveying goods and people around the city. To satisfy the horses’ thirst, numerous watering fountains and troughs were installed along the city’s streets. Many were erected by humane societies such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). In addition to fulfilling a necessary function of preserving the health of beasts of burden, these roadside fountains often exhibited a great degree of artistry in their design and ornamentation.
<br><br>
The decline of horse-drawn commercial vehicles resulted in the virtual elimination of these fountains by World War II. While the Hamilton Fountain survived, it fell into disrepair, was vandalized, and its plumbing ceased to function. For a period neighborhood volunteers maintained aquatic plants in the still water of the basin, and even koi swam here. In 2009 private donations to the Riverside Park Fund made possible the restoration of the fountain, including conservation of the ornamentation, installation of new electrical and plumbing service, repaving of the plaza with hexagonal blocks, and planting four serviceberry trees (Amelanchier spp.). The Riverside Park Fund has also established a maintenance fund to provide for the ongoing care of this significant historic monument.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Carl Schurz (1829-1906) was born in Liblar, Prussia (near what is now Cologne, Germany). In 1848, while a doctoral candidate at the University of Bonn, he joined the democratic revolt opposing the autocratic German government. After participating in rebellions in the Rhineland, the Palatinate, and in Baden, Schurz was imprisoned, escaped, and fled to Switzerland. After a short stay in Switzerland he resided in France and England before immigrating to the United States in 1852. Schurz eventually settled in New York City in 1881.<br><br>

Shurz was a prodigious learner and mastered the English language, while earning a law degree, within three years of settling in America. He soon established a reputation as a skilled orator and proved to be instrumental in the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Schurz was appointed Minister to Spain in 1861. He was a staunch abolitionist and when he returned to the United States in 1862 Schurz was appointed as a Major General in the Union army.
<br><br>
After commanding troops in Virginia, Schurz returned North in 1864 making numerous campaign speeches on behalf of Lincoln and was General Slouch's chief of staff before reentering civilian life. He prepared a report on post-war racial integration in the Southern states for President Andrew Johnson and then served as the Washington correspondent for Horace Greeley’s New York Tribune.
<br><br>
Admired for his eloquence and political acumen, Schurz was elected United States Senator from Missouri in 1869 and served until 1875. He was appointed Secretary of the Interior in 1877 by Rutherford B. Hayes, where he was a strong proponent of civil service reform. He worked for improvements in the treatment of Native Americans in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In his later years, Schurz was editor of the New York Tribune and an editorial writer for Harper’s Weekly. Upon his death in 1906, prominent lawyer Joseph H. Choate formed a memorial committee and raised $93,000 in donations towards a monument for Schurz.

This impressive monument to Schurz is the result of a collaboration between the distinguished Austrian sculptor Karl Bitter (1867&#8211;1915) and renowned architect Henry Bacon (1866&#8211;1924). In 1908, Bitter was selected to create the sculpture after already having received many public commissions including the Franz Sigel statue (1907) on Riverside Drive. He also modeled the maquette for the figure of Pomona atop the Pulitzer Fountain in Manhattan's Grand Army Plaza. Bitter selected the site of the Schurz Monument for its advantageous position and enlisted Bacon to assist in the designs. Bacon later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Metropolitan Pool in Brooklyn, and early electrical lamp-posts for Central Park<br><br>

Built in 1913 within a large brick-paved plaza projecting from the promontory at Morningside Drive and 116th Street, the monument consists of a full standing bronze portrait of Schurz in the center of a granite exedra (curved bench) with carved reliefs framed by two ornamental bronze luminaires. Other studio assistants and associates of Bitter may have worked on the side and central stone relief carvings which relate to Schurz’s social concerns about African-American slaves and Native Americans. The low relief carvings in granite were made by the Bronx-based Piccirilli studios after clay and plaster models by Bitter. Set at the center and silhouetted against the sky, is the imposing figure of Carl Schurz.<br><br>

The monument underwent extensive conservation in the late 1930s, at which time incised inscriptions replaced bronze lettering and less distinctive light poles were substituted for the originals. Following renovations to historic Morningside Park, Parks' Citywide Monuments Conservation Program conserved the main statue and the flanking reliefs in 2003.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Born on the Lower East Side, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland, abstract expressionist Barnett Newman was one of the foremost color field painters of the mid-twentieth century. His rejection of expressive brushstrokes, in favor of harder-edged fields of pure flat color, was a precursor to minimalism, and an important influence on younger artists. Many of his works had a philosophical bent, and reflected his interest in myths and the primitive unconscious. His trademark "zips", a lifelong feature of his work, were characterized by a thin, vertical line that zips through large areas of color. Newman's series, "The Stations of the Cross" (1958-66), considered the peak of his achievement, and started shortly before he moved here with his wife, Annalee, has been interpreted as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. His best-known sculpture, "Broken Obelisk" (1963) depicts an inverted obelisk, whose point balances on the apex of a pyramid.]]></desc>

Few structures by this important American architect survive in New York City. This building is distinguished by its picturesque roof treatment, punctuated by multiple dormer windows and corner towers. An addition by Charles A. Rich in 1907-08 conforms to the style of the original building. Established in 1813 to aid widows of both the American Revolution and the War of 1812, the Association was one of the City's earliest charitable organizations Designated a New York City Landmark in 1983, the building was converted to a branch of Hosteling International in 1990.]]></desc>

With George Balanchine, he created the School of American Ballet in 1934, and served as its President until 1989. Beginning in 1935, he attempted to launch four different ballet companies before successfully establishing the New York City Ballet with Balanchine in 1948. Kirstein was the company's General Director for over 40 years, until 1989. A supporter of modernism across the arts, in 1928 Kirstein co-founded with John Walker III and Edward M.M. Warburg, the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art; this group led, the following year, to the founding of the Museum of Modern Art. A scholar, writer and outspoken critic, Kirstein authored more than 500 articles, poems, reviews, books and essays on the visual and performing arts, history, and literature. He founded the Dance Archives at New York's Museum of Modern Art (1940), as well as Dance Index magazine, of which he was editor from 1942 to 1948. His many honors include the Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts.<br><br>

After college, he apprenticed as a journalist and writer of short stories; and lived here from 1910 to 1913 while working at New York publishing houses as a copywriter, and editor. After 1916, he began work on a realistic novel criticizing small town conformity that became the best seller, <i>Main Street </i>(1920), following that two years later with <i>Babbitt</i>, a satire of middle-class boosterism set in the Midwest. Several of Lewis' novels were adapted for the movies, including <i>Arrowsmith</i> (1925) (for which he won, but turned down, a Pulitzer Prize), <i>Elmer Gantry</i> (1927), and <i>Dodsworth</i> (1929), also a Broadway play. Lewis wrote eleven more novels after his Nobel Prize, most notoriously, <i>It Can't Happen Here</i> (1936), which envisioned fascism coming to America. It was staged nationally by the Federal Theater. Lewis died in Italy in 1951.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[General Philip Henry Sheridan]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Christopher Street, New York, (On the left when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This expressive bronze portrait of General Philip Henry Sheridan (1831-1888), created by Joseph Pollia (1893-1954), was unveiled in Christopher Park in 1936. The sculpture honors the distinguished Civil War cavalry commander for whom the surrounding square was named in 1896. It is one of nine statues of Civil War generals in New York City parks.<br><br>

Sheridan was born on March 6, 1831, and enrolled at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1848. He graduated in 1853, and was appointed brevet 2nd lieutenant in the 1st Infantry. After rising to the rank of captain in 1861, Sheridan was appointed chief quartermaster and commissary of the army in southwestern Missouri. After difficult, but effective, quartermaster work in the Mississippi campaign of 1862, Sheridan was named colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry. <br><br>

The success of Sheridan’s 1862-63 campaign led General Grant to place him in charge of the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac, and then the Army of the Shendandoah. Sheridan’s most storied victory of this period was the battle of Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley. His heroic acts on October 19, 1864 were immortalized in Thomas Buchanan Read’s poem, Sheridan’s Ride. <br><br>

In 1865, Sheridan’s bold military tactics achieved victory over General Pickett at Five Forks, Virginia, and at the war’s end, Sheridan was promoted to Major General and assigned to the southwest to counter Maximilian’s French troops in Mexico. In 1867, Sheridan was made a military governor of the district encompassing Louisiana and Texas, and then the Department of Missouri. Promoted by Grant in 1869 to lieutenant general, Sheridan then succeeded General Sherman in 1884 as commander-in-chief of the United States Army. In 1888, Sheridan was promoted to full general and he published his memoirs. He died that same year of a heart attack at age 57. He is remembered as a brilliant military tactician and an assertive commander in battle.<br><br>

In 1924, the General Sheridan Memorial Committee was organized by John B. Trainer, former secretary of the Armory Board of New York City. The committee raised $6,000 through public subscription to erect the statue in Christopher Park. The statue was dedicated in elaborate ceremonies on October 19, 1936, coinciding with the 72nd anniversary of the Cedar Creek victory. A time capsule, including the names of all contributors, was sealed at the base of the statue. Italian-born sculptor Joseph Pollia, who created the statue of Sheridan, received numerous public commissions, and in 1926, also sculpted the World War I Doughboy figure known as My Buddy or the Richmond Hill War Memorial, which stands in Forest Park, Queens.<br><br>
Although many images of the general show him astride his horse Rienzi, Sheridan’s larger-than-life statue depicts him standing in full Union Army regalia, booted and spurred, with a sword swinging at his side. It is set within a fenced and landscaped enclosure, atop a granite base that includes an inscription on its north face attributed to General Ulysses S. Grant: &#8220;He belongs to the first rank of soldiers, not only of our country, but of the world.&#8221;<br><br>

In 2000, the City Parks Foundation Monuments Conservation Program conserved the sculpture. Funding for the project came through numerous contributions in a campaign spearheaded by Robert W. Lord, a descendant of four Civil War soldiers for the Union. Additional matching funds from the American Express Company, the Florence Gould Foundation, and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation made the project possible. On October 19, 2000, the statue was rededicated in a ceremony that recalled the original dedication, and a time capsule of new contributors was buried near the base of the monument.<br><br>]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Christopher Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This sculpture by George Segal (1924&#8211;2000) honors the gay rights movement and commemorates the uprising which took place at the Stonewall Inn opposite this park in Sheridan Square in 1969.<br><br>
The Stonewall Inn at 51-53 Christopher Street was built as two stables during the 1840s. In 1930 these were combined into one building that housed Bonnie's Stone Wall teahouse, and later the Stonewall Inn Restaurant. In 1967 the establishment was converted to an unlicensed private club also called the Stonewall Inn - a bar and dance hall which catered to the vibrant gay community of Greenwich Village. <br><br>

In the early hours of June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn and a fight broke out in which 13 people were arrested. The patrons and a growing crowd refused to disperse and clashed with police reinforcements. Word of the raid and uprising spread, and the next day hundreds gathered to protest the crackdown and advocate for the legalization of gay bars. Further protests erupted in early July, and on July 27 a group of activists organized the first gay and lesbian march from Washington Square to the Stonewall. The events of that summer are often cited as the beginning of the gay rights movement in the United States.<br><br>

In 1979, arts patron Peter Putnam (1927&#8211;1987) commissioned the <i>Gay Liberation Monument</i>. Segal, though not the first artist approached, accepted the commission, which stipulated only that the work &#8220;had to be loving and caring, and show the affection that is the hallmark of gay people . . . and it had to have equal representation of men and women.&#8221;<br><br>

Segal was one of the most important and influential American artists in the late 20th century. Born and raised in New York City, he settled in 1940 on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey where he lived and worked until his death. His work is in more than 65 public collections. Some of his better known pieces are <i>The Commuters</i> (1982) in New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal, <i>The Holocaust</i> (1984) in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, and his tableaux for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, DC. (1995).<br><br>

Segal's composition for <i>Gay Liberation</i> consists of two standing males and two seated females positioned on the northern boundary of the park, in naturalistic poses. Using a process typical of his work, Segal made bronze casts from plaster molds of human models, and included metal replicas of standard park benches. The effect is realistic yet enigmatic, as he tempered the cast surfaces with an unearthly white painted finish.
<br><br>
The project was approved by the City in 1982, but the installation was delayed a decade because of public opposition, a planned park renovation, and the death of a sponsor. On June 23rd, Mayor David Dinkins and Parks Commissioner Betsy Gottbaum dedicated the monument.<br><br>

 In the intervening decade the opposition and rancor which had greeted the project had subsided. The AIDS epidemic, which had devastated the gay community, added to the impact of its mute figures. In March 2000, for their role in the gay rights movement, the Stonewall Inn and Christopher Park were designated a National Historic Landmark, and Segal’s sculpture has become a popular pilgrimage site.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The land that is now Christopher Park was developed from 1633 to 1638 as a tobacco farm by Wouter Van Twiller, Director-General of New Netherland. Following Van Twiller’s death, his land was divided into three farms: the Trinity Church and Elbert Herring farms to the south and Sir Peter Warren’s farm to the north. Skinner Road was laid out along the line separating the Warren farm from the other two. This road was later renamed Christopher Street, honoring Charles Christopher Amos, an heir of a trustee to the Warren estate
<br><br>
Between 1789 and 1829, Christopher Street was subdivided into lots, and blocks were laid out along its length. Due to the irregular configuration of streets in Greenwich Village, blocks were not laid out according to a standard grid plan, and many oddly-shaped blocks were created. In the early 1800s, the population of Greenwich Village expanded dramatically, and the area around Christopher Street began to suffer from overcrowding. When a devastating fire tore through the area in 1835, residents petitioned the City to condemn a triangular block at the intersection of Christopher, Grove, and West 4th Streets and establish a much-needed open space on the site. On April 5, 1837 the City condemned the parcel and created Christopher Park.
<br><br>
With the widening of Seventh Avenue and the construction of the IRT subway line in 1910, Greenwich Village became divided between the working-class neighborhood to the west and an artistic, Bohemian community to the east. The destruction of several blocks of Christopher Street in order to widen Seventh Avenue and the opening of the Christopher Street subway station placed Christopher Park at the center of this division. Tension developed among various groups in the Christopher Street area as the population of Greenwich Village began to decline in the 1940s.
<br><br>
On June 27, 1969, there was rioting on Christopher Street when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay establishment, in order to curb liquor law violations. Over the next few days, in what is known as the Stonewall Rebellion, several thousand rioters filled the streets to protest the police action. Thereafter, Christopher Park became a symbol of the gay liberation movement. In 1999 the site of the Stonewall uprising&#8212;the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and the surrounding neighborhood streets&#8212;were placed on the New York State Register of Historic Places and added to the National Register.
<br><br>
The restoration of Christopher Park was initiated in 1983 by the Friends of Christopher Park, a community volunteer group organized in the late 1970s to maintain and beautify the park. Under the direction of landscape architect Philip Winslow, over $130,000 was spent in order to restore the site to its 19th-century splendor. The renovated park, including a new gate, benches, lampposts, walkways, and numerous trees and shrubs, was officially reopened in 1986.<br><br>

Christopher Park, which is graced with a 130-year-old fence, contains several monuments. The flagpole, erected in 1936, commemorates several of the 1861 Fire Zouaves, an elite Civil War unit that wore uniforms styled after North African tribesmen. A bronze statue by Joseph P. Pollia of General Philip H. Sheridan, a celebrated cavalry leader during the Civil War, was installed in 1936. George Segal’s statue Gay Liberation, a duplicate of the one installed at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, was placed in Christopher Park in 1992.]]></desc>

Noted architect John Kellum designed the building and the leading firm of J.B. and W.W. Cornell manufactured the cast iron. McCreery's was part of the Ladies' Mile Shopping District for many years, but left the site in 1902, after which it became a factory for ladies' shoes and handbags. A fire in 1971 almost insured the building's doom, but the cast-iron facade and interior elements survived, and in 1972-1973 the building was resurrected for residential use., the first such conversion of a loft building in the city. The Cast Iron Building (as McCreery's) is prominently mentioned in the best-selling novel, "The Alienist," by East Village author Caleb Carr.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Central Park's Ancient Egyptian Obelisk]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near East Drive, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[For such a colossal object, this obelisk is well-travelled. Central Park is the third location for this 220-ton granite monument, which is the oldest public monument in New York City.<p>
Pharaoh Thutmose III commissioned this obelisk approximately 3500 years ago (c. 1425 B.C.E.). It was one of a pair that was installed outside the Temple of the Sun in Heliopolis, a city north of modern-day Cairo. Scholars believe that obelisks were symbols of eternity and immortality, with their tall, tapering forms connecting the earth to the sun. The surface of the obelisk is covered in hieroglyphics that praise Thutmose III and subsequent rulers.<p>
Around 12 B.C.E. the Romans discovered the two obelisks that had toppled and were partially buried in the sand. They transported the obelisks to Alexandria, Egypt where they were installed at the entrance to the Caesareum, a temple dedicated to Julius Caesar. The Romans also added the bronze crabs, to provide support where the corners of the shaft had been damaged, and the stepped limestone base.<p>
During the 1800s, interest in Egyptian antiquities renewed attention to obelisks and other artifacts, which were acquired by European nations and gifted by the Egyptian government to further diplomatic ties. In 1869, the Khedive of Egypt offered this obelisk to the United States, and prominent New Yorkers began to plan for its removal. The transportation and installation of the obelisk was a significant feat of logistics and engineering that took over a year and marked a defining moment for the city. In January 1881, the obelisk was erected in its current location across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was instrumental in its acquisition.<p>
In 2011 the Central Park Conservancy embarked on a project to conserve the obelisk, the most comprehensive in its history. This included extensive documentation of the monument, a thorough cleaning of the granite, and repair and protection of areas of fragility on its surface. The project has restored the obelisk to its former prominence, revealing once again the color and texture of the granite and the hieroglyphics on its surface, and will help preserve this treasure of ancient culture for future generations.]]></desc>

July 24, 1920 &#8212; March 31, 1998<br>
2 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan</center>
Born in The Bronx to Russian immigrants, Bella Abzug was a graduate of Hunter College (1942) and Columbia Law School (1947). A labor and civil rights lawyer, much of her work was pro bono defense for victims of injustice. A cofounder of Women Strike for Peace (1961), the national women's peace movement, and the National Women's Political Caucus (1971), created to increase women's participation in politics, she entered politics with a successful run for Congress (1970). On her first day there, Abzug introduced a bill to end the Vietnam War; in 1975, she introduced the first Congressional gay rights bill. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate (1976), she left the House in 1977. Though she never again held elected office, Abzug remained dedicated to social action and politics, and co-founded the Women's Environmental Development Organization (1991). Married to lawyer Martin Abzug from 1944 until his death in 1986, they raised two daughters, Eve and Liz.

2 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan</center>
Edward Irving Koch, Mayor of New York City from 1978 through 1989, was born in The Bronx to immigrant parents. During his three terms in office, he executed twelve balanced budgets, created the largest municipal housing program in the country, and restored the spirit, and pride, of the citizens of New York City. A graduate of NYU Law School in 1948, he began his political career as a reformer, joining the Village Independent Democrats. Elected to the City Council in 1966, Congressman Koch represented the East Side of New York City in the House of Representatives from 1969 to 1978. Following his mayoralty, he became a partner at a law firm, and continued to play a role in politics. Koch wrote a weekly column for several publications, appeared regularly as a commentator on radio and television, and may be best remembered for his trademark phrase "How'm I doin'?"

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Frederick Douglass Boulevard, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This larger-than-life bronze sculpture depicts abolitionist organizer and Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman (c. 1822-1913), and stands at the crossroads of St. Nicholas Avenue, West 122nd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. Douglass once said of Tubman that except for John Brown, he knew of "no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people."<br><br>

Born into slavery in Maryland around 1822, Tubman escaped in 1849 via the Underground Railroad, the network of places and people dedicated to helping slaves find their way to freedom in non-slaveholding communities. Settling first in Philadelphia, then Canada, Tubman spent ten years returning to Maryland at great personal risk, to guide scores of friends and family members to freedom. Determined to end slavery, she later served the Union Army as a scout, spy and nurse in the Civil War. Settling in Auburn, New York after the war, she continued campaigning for equal rights for women and African-Americans. Her humanitarian work, including caring for the sick, homeless and disabled of all races, resulted in the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged in that community. She died in 1913 and was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn with semi-military honors.<br><br>

The memorial, commissioned through the Department of Cultural Affairs' Percent for Art program, was created by African-American sculptor Alison Saar. The artist has depicted Tubman "not as the conductor of the Underground Railroad but as the train itself, an unstoppable locomotive,&#8221; the roots of slavery pulled up in her wake. Saar designed stylized portraits of "anonymous passengers" of the Underground Railroad in Tubman's skirt, some of which were inspired by West African "passport masks." Around the granite base of the monument are bronze tiles alternately depicting events in Tubman's life and traditional quilting patterns.<br><br>

The $2.8 million, multi-agency project, which included the landscaping of a formerly barren traffic triangle, was sponsored by former Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields. Designed by Quennell Rothschild and constructed by URS, the renovated triangle features paving blocks and roughly hewn granite to create a natural setting. Plantings native to both New York and Tubman's home state of Maryland represent the woods and terrain traveled by Tubman and her Underground Railroad passengers, providing a contemplative space in which to consider Tubman's legacy.<br><br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA["The idea of separatism is harkening to the past and it is undesirable even if it could be realized, because the progress of mankind has been based upon ... social, intellectual and cultural contact." &#8212;A. Philip Randolph, 1969<br><br>

Asa Philip Randolph (1889-1979), labor and civil rights leader, was born in Crescent City, Florida on April 15,1889. After graduating from the Cookman Institute in Jacksonville, Randolph continued his education at City College, which he began attending shortly after he moved to New York in 1911. In 1917 Randolph and Chandler Owen founded the Messenger, a radical monthly publication that urged black industrial workers to unionize. In 1925 the sleeping-car porters of the Pullman Railroad Company, drawn to Randolph's militant stance on labor and race issues, asked him to organize a union.<br><br>
 
After ten years of negotiations, the managers of the Pullman Company met Randolph's demands. They granted $2 million in wage increases and officially recognized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first black union in the country.<br><br>

Randolph successfully pressured President Roosevelt to issue the historic Executive Order 8802 on July 31, 1941 which banned discrimination in the defense industry and led to the establishment of the Fair Employment Practice Commission. In 1955 the veteran labor leader became the first black vice-president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). On August 28, 1963, Randolph and Bayard Rustin directed the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, during which civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. In 1965, they founded the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen ties between labor and civil rights organizations.<br><br>

This site was acquired by the City in 1896. It formerly contained one of the many brownstone milestone markers, c. 1769, that denoted the distance of various sites from City Hall. The area was named Dewey Square by the Board of Aldermen in 1922 for Admiral George B. Dewey (1837-1917), a naval hero of the Spanish American War, for whom the promenade in Battery Park along New York Harbor is named. Dewey Square also provided the inspiration for and title of a 1947 song by saxophonist Charlie Parker, who lived in the area at the time.<br><br>
The area was renamed for A. Philip Randolph in 1964 by the City Council, under a local law introduced by Council Member J. Raymond Jones and signed by Mayor John V. Lindsay.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Kips Bay, once known as Kepp’s Bay, was the site of the British Army’s invasion of Manhattan (September 15, 1776) early in the revolution. <br>
A mixed force of about 4,000 British regulars and Hessian mercenaries landed at what is now the 34th Street in pursuit of General George Washington’s Continental Army. Kips Bay then extended from about 32nd to about 38th streets and west to nearly Second Avenue. <br><br>
Using 75 flatboats, and other small craft, which had been hidden at the mouth of Newton Creek (Queens), and under the furious, if ineffective, bombardment from the guns of four warships, the Americans abandoned their position. Washington’s army withdrew in disorder but was saved from destruction by a rear guard of the Continental Army’s Maryland Regiments. <br><br>
The invaders seized Inclenberg, home of Robert Murray (about 37th Street and Park Avenue), giving rise to the apocryphal tale of Colonial sympathizers entertaining English generals to delay the British while the American Army escaped. <br><br>
More traditional east-west ferries came with the Long Island Rail Road’s service between Kips Bay and Hunter’s Point, Queens (1859-1925), using 19 boats. In 1866 service was every fifteen minutes and cost three cents. <br><br>
From 1880 to 1930 passengers could leave the ferry and, in a practically direct connection, walk to 34th Street spur of the now demolished Third Avenue elevated railroad. The spur was demolished in 1931. <br><br>
The East 34th Street Vehicular Ferry Company (1927-1936), operated from Borden Avenue, long Island City, Queens, using three boats for passengers and cars, to Kips Bay dock. <br><br>
Kips Bay, Turtle Bay, and both Murray Hill and Tudor City, which are designated New York City Landmarks, are home to some of the foremost examples of quality urban architecture. <br><br>
Kips Bay’s diverse character is reflected in the Saint Vartan Cathedrals of the Armenian Orthodox Church in America, Second Avenue and 34th Street; and half block west of 34th Street is the Estonian House, an 1889 Beaux Arts jewel of a building; the world renowned Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, 34th Street and First Avenue and New York University Medical Center.<br>
Further south on First Avenue is the Bellevue Hospital center, site of the McKim, Mead and White (1908) Psychiatric Hospital building, 30th Streets east of First Avenue. <br><br>
Murray Hill, a Historic District, is home to the Stern College for Women of Yeshiva University, Lexington Avenue between 34th and 35th streets, the Pierpont Morgan Library, East 36th Street and Madison Avenue and Siffen Court Historic District, East 36th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues. The factory, (at both 19 East 32nd Street and 22nd and 22 East 33rd Streets) was the studio of artist Andy Warhol. <br><br>
Tudor City Historic District 41st to 43rd Streets, between First and Second Avenues, and which sits astride Tudor City Place, is a trailbreaking planned city within a city. North on First Avenue is the United nations campus, with its Secretariat Building and the later Library addition. The world organization is housed from 42nd to 48th streets, east of First Avenue. The U.N. neighborhood, and adjacent Turtle Bay, are home to embassies, missions and consulates of nations from around the world.]]></desc>

When Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux designed Central Park in 1858, they left relatively untouched the rocky Promontory on the north edge of the swamp which was to be transformed into the Pond. The four-acre woodland was formally closed to the public and declared the Bird Sanctuary in 1934. The area was renamed the Hallett Nature Sanctuary in 1986 after George Hallett, Jr., (1895-1965) a prominent leader in New York City’s civic movement for over half a century and an ardent nature lover and bird watcher.<br><br>
The seclusion of this area from the general public allows many species of animal and plantlife to flourish in a more natural ecological community than elsewhere in Central Park.<br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This striking gateway, designed by Edward Coe Embury (1906 -1990) with sculpture by Paul Manship (1885-1966), was created as part of Central Park’s children’s zoo which opened in 1961.  The zoo was first known as the Lehman Zoo for Children, as funds for its construction were given by former New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman (1878-1963, governor 1933-1942)  and his wife Edith on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary.<br><br>
The most notable feature of the gateway is the bronze tableau that straddles three piers made of Swenson green granite.  Manship’s fanciful sculpture shows a boy prancing with goats, to the music of panpipes played by two smaller boys seated at either end. Birds roost on the stylized vine that arches over the two entrance portals.<br><br>
Paul Manship was a notable 20th- century sculptor, whose aesthetic was inspired by many artistic traditions from archaic Greek classicism to Near Eastern art.  His most famous work in New York City is the Art Deco - styled, gilded Prometheus at Rockefeller Center, completed in 1934.  For the New York World’s Fair of 1939-40 at Flushing Meadows, he created an enormous sundial entitled Time and the Fates as well as four fountain sculptures called Moods of Time.  Manship’s Armillary Sphere created for the World’s Fair of 1964-65 was bequeathed as a permanent feature of Flushing Meadows Corona Park only to be stolen in 1980 in one of the most brazen acts of vandalism in a New York City park.<br><br>
Elsewhere in the city’s parks Manship also left his mark.  The elaborate Rainey Gates were installed in 1934 at the north entrance of the Bronx Zoo.  They show a menagerie of animals, some of which Manship modeled after inhabitants of the zoo in the late 1920s. His life renderings of bears led him to execute several versions of varying scale &#8211; those on the piers at the Rainey Gates, as well as a posthumous large-scale casting placed in 1990 at the Pat Hoffman Playground in Central Park at East 79th Street.<br><br>
On Manhattan’s Lower East Side, Manship created the sculptural flagstaff base for the Alfred E. Smith Playground, which again adopted the artist’s common motifs of deer, birds and bears.  In 1953 Manship sculpted ornate gates on the theme of Aesop’s Fables for the William Church Osborn Playground (now the site of the Metropolitan Museum’s Temple of Dendur).  Later vandalized, and long in storage, the gates were restored by the Central Park Conservancy and reinstalled in 2009 at the entrance to the Ancient Playground at Fifth Avenue and 85th Street.<br><br>
In 1997, the landscape of the 1960’s-era children’s zoo -- perhaps best remembered for the larger-than-life play features of Jonah’s Whale and Noah’s Ark -- was replaced with a more naturalistic woodlands design by Quennell Rothschild. The redesigned zoo was named for Laurence A. Tisch, who sponsored its construction. <p> 
The sculptural gateway has remained throughout these changes, as compatible with the new zoo design as with the previous one, and serves as an enduring example of the power of Manship’s art to inspire and delight many generations.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Sir Walter Scott]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near The Mall, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This larger-than-life-sized bronze portrait of Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott (1771&#8211;1832) was dedicated on the &#8220;Literary Walk&#8221; in Central Park in 1872.<br><br>
Scott was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and had an early career in the legal profession. His literary endeavors were launched when he anonymously published translations of Burger’s Lenore and Der Wilde Jager, and Goethe’s Gotz von Berlichgen (1799). In 1802, Scott issued the first two volumes of Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, a collection of old ballads, which reflected his interest in the native language and traditions of his country. His first significant original work was The Lay of the Last Minstrel, a narrative poem published in 1805.
Over the next quarter-century, Scott established himself as the pre-eminent Scottish author, and helped transform contemporary literature. He is credited with inventing the historical novel, and was a prolific practitioner of this genre. Waverley (1814) and Ivanhoe (1819) are some of the most famous examples of Scott’s romantic classics. Other well-known works include Rob Roy (1817), The Heart of Midlothian (1818), and The Bride of Lammermoor (1819).<br><br>
In addition to his novels, he published a narrative poem, Lady of the Lake (1810), edited the author John Dryden’s (1631-1700) works (1808), published several plays, the nineteen-volume set of The Life and Works of Swift (1814), the nine-volume Life of Napoleon (1827),  and a History of Scotland (1830). Yet at the height of his fame as a man of letters, Scott suffered enormous financial setbacks and declared bankruptcy.  He suffered two strokes in 1830, and died as a result two years later. It was only after his death that his debts were paid through the proceeds received from his numerous publications.<br><br>
Throughout his career Scott’s work was marked with nostalgia and pride in Scotland’s past married with an acute awareness of its place in the modern world. It was Scott who rediscovered the country’s crown jewels, the Honours of Scotland, unearthing them from bricked-up chamber in Edinburgh Castle in 1818 after they had been lost for over 100 years.  His novels based on Scotland’s history made the country a tourist destination, and some credit him with popularizing the romantic view of the country’s geography and culture that endures today.<br><br>
In celebration of the centennial of Sir Walter Scott’s birth, a group of prominent Scottish citizens arranged for the placement of this sculpture in Central Park. They selected John Steell (1804-1891), a renowned sculptor from Edinburgh, to create a bronze replica of his marble of Scott (1845), the first such monument to a Scot to be created by a native artist.<br><br>
Steell was born in Aberdeen, and was the son of a wood carver. After studying at the Trustees Academy and also in Rome, he became a member of The Royal Scottish Academy, and was appointed in 1838 Sculptor of the Queen of Scotland. He produced numerous public and private art commissions, and managed a foundry, which introduced the art of bronze casting to Scotland.<br><br>
Steell’s effigy of Scott in Central Park eliminates the Gothic stone canopy - which critics have likened to &#8220;a spire without a cathedral&#8221; - of the original on Princes Street in Edinburgh.  Scott is depicted seated on a rock, in a flowing cloak with workingman’s shoes, with book and pen in hand. Beside him sits his faithful hound. The completed statue was formally unveiled here on November 2, 1872, where it joined the sculpture of William Shakespeare, installed earlier that year. A legion of Highlanders from the 79th Regiment, the National Guard and the Caledonian Club were part of the festivities. Among the speakers was poet, editor, and civic leader William Cullen Bryant (1794&#8211;1878), who commented, &#8220;and now as the statue of Scott is set up in this beautiful park, which a few years since, possessed no human associations, historical or poetic, connected with its shades, its lawns, its rocks and waters, these grounds become peopled with new memories.&#8221;<br><br>
In 1936 NYC Parks’ monuments crew repaired the base and repatinated the bronze.
In 1993, both the pedestal and sculpture were again conserved through the Adopt-A-Monument Program, a joint venture of the Municipal Art Society, NYC Parks, and the New York City Art Commission (now the Public Design Commission). The restoration was funded by the Saint Andrew’s Society, which has also established a fund for ongoing care.<br>]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Robert Burns Statue]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near The Mall, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This statue of Scottish national poet Robert Burns (1759&#8211;1796), companion to the 1872 Sir Walter Scott (1771&#8211;1832) sculpture across Literary Walk, is by Sir John Steell (1804&#8211;1891), and was dedicated in 1880.<br><br>
Burns was born in Alloway, Ayrshire, the son of a tenant farmer. His father died in 1784, and Burns became head of the household, but he had already started writing poetry. On July 3, 1786, he published his Poems, Chiefly in a Scottish Dialect, in nearby Kilmarnock, to enormous success in both countryside and city. Burns left his farm for Edinburgh on November 27, 1786, but the fame and attention he received there put him ill at ease; he never found a comfortable place in contemporary society’s class distinctions.<br><br>
Poems earned Burns fame in his lifetime, but little money.  He published a second, enlarged, edition in Edinburgh in 1787, but by the summer of 1788 had taken up tenant farming again, in Ellisland, Dumfriesshire, where he struggled. He kept up an active literary and intellectual life, and obtained a post in the excise service in 1789.  He moved to Dumfries in 1791, and lived there until his death on July 21, 1796, of chronic rheumatic heart disease. <br><br>
Burns is a national hero. Known affectionately as &#8220;Rabbie,&#8221; his works are unmatched by any other Scottish artist as a source of national pride.  His birthday, January 25 (&#8220;Burns Night&#8221;), is celebrated throughout the country and by Scots and admirers around the world with a banquet - a haggis (a Scottish delicacy made from calf or sheep organ meat boiled in the stomach of the animal) as the centerpiece, ceremoniously addressed with Burns’s odes to haggis and whisky before being served.<br><br>  
Burns’ genius was his poetic use of the rhythms and dialects of everyday speech, and it was his personal mission to revive traditional Scottish song.  He traveled the country, collecting tunes, airs, fragments of expressions and songs, and created songs whole, even writing words to folk tunes which had never had lyrics.  He captured something of the Scottish spirit which has endured, and each generation has claimed him again as its own, even as Scotland has struggled in a search for identity. He is credited with &#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221;, and his best-known poems include &#8220;Scots, Wha Hae,&#8221; &#8220;Tam O’Shanter,&#8221; and &#8220;To a Mouse.&#8221;<br><br>
Not long after the unveiling of Sir Walter Scott in 1872, a committee formed to erect a monument to Burns. A year later, specifying only the material and colossal size, it selected the same sculptor, John Steell, to create Scott’s bronze counterpart. Steell was born in Aberdeen, the son of a wood carver, and studied at the Trustees Academy, and in Rome.  He became a member of The Royal Scottish Academy, and in 1838 was appointed Sculptor of the Queen of Scotland, producing numerous public and private art commissions, and managing a foundry, which introduced the art of bronze casting to Scotland.<br><br>
Steell’s melodramatic conception depicts Burns seated on a tree stump, quill pen in hand, eyes turned heavenward in a pose of inspiration. At his feet is a poem dedicated to his lost love, Mary Campbell, and a plough alluding to his agrarian origins. The sculpture was unveiled on October 3, 1880, and the ceremony was attended by 5,000 people, area Caledonian clubs in full Highland dress, and 100 distinguished guests, with music by Grafulla’s Band.<br><br>
Wallace Bruce wrote &#8220;Walter Scott’s Greeting to Robert Burns,&#8221; whose first lines read: &#8220;We greet you Rabbie here tonight; Beneath these stars so pure and bright; we greet you, Poet, come at last; With Will [Shakespeare] and me your lot to cast.&#8221;  Robert Burns also joined the 1876 statue of American poet Fitz-Greene Halleck (1790-1867), whose 1822 poem &#8220;Burns&#8221; read in part, &#8220;But what to them the sculptor’s art; His funeral columns, wreaths and urns? Wear they not graven on the heart, the name of Robert Burns.&#8221;<br><br>
In 1940, NYC Parks’ monuments crew reconstructed the statue’s unstable pedestal. It was rebuilt again in 1993; the quill, missing, was replicated; and the sculpture conserved through the Adopt-A-Monument Program, a joint venture of the Municipal Art Society, NYC Parks and the New York City Art Commission (now the Public Design Commission).  The restoration was funded by the Saint Andrew’s Society, which established a fund for ongoing care. On October 26, 1996, hundreds gathered here for the bicentennial of Burns’ death; world-renowned folk singer Jean Redpath performed, and the event was supported by the Burns Society of the City of New York, the American-Scottish Foundation, the St. Andrew’s Society of the State of New York, the New Caledonian Club, and Scottish Heritage USA.]]></desc>

Origins</center><br>
Duane Park was the first open space acquired by the City of New York specifically for use as a public park. It is located on Duane Street, which was named for James Duane, New York’s first mayor (1784-89) after the American Revolution.<br>
The park is the last remnant of Greensward of the Annetje Jans farm granted in 1636 by Governor Woulter van Twiller to Roeloff and Annetje Jans. After the death of Roeloff Jans, his widow married the Reverend Everardus Bogardus, second minister of the Dutch Church of New Amsterdam, and the farm became known as the Dominie’s Bouwery, of the Minister’s Farm.<br><br>
It was sold in 1670 to the English governor, Sir Francis Lovelace, but was later confiscated by the Duke of York and deeded in 1795 to Trinity Church.<br>
This triangle was purchased from Trinity Church by the City of New York in 1797 for the sum of five dollars, to be used as a park for the public<br><br>

Design</center><br>
Originally an open commons, the park was later enclosed by an iron fence. By 1870 it had been enlarged and landscaped with trees, lawn and shrubs accorded to a design by Parks Chief Engineer Montgomery A. Kellogg and Chief Gardner Ignatz A. Pilat.<br>
In 1887, as part of a citywide effort to improve public access to enclosed park lands, Parks Superintendent Samuel Parsons Jr. and Landscape Architect Calvert Vaux designed a plan with paths curving in from each surrounding street.<br>
In 1940 Chief Consultant Landscape Architect Gilmore D. Clarke and Parks Landscape Architect Janet Patt redesigned the park in a formal Beaux-Arts style, and a central flagpole inscribed with Duane Park’s history was added.<br>
The 1999 plan, by Landscape Architect Signe Nielsen, replaced paved areas with planting to evoke the more pastoral 1887 design of the park.<br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Pier A, a designated New York City landmark, was constructed by the Department of Docks' third Engineer-in-Chief, George S. Greene Jr. between 1884 and 1886. 
The pier's two-story building served as the headquarters of the Department of Docks and the Police Department's Harbor Patrol and was also home to a firehouse for the Fire Department's Marine Division. 
This photograph depicts Pier A between 1902 and 1904 after the construction of an inshore extension but before the addition of the third story in 1904. 

<br><br>
Pier A and the adjacent plaza were renovated between 2008 and 2013. The work included repairs to the substructure, replacement of the pier decking, and refurbishment of the building façade. The sculpted cast iron flagpole bases, which are visible in the photograph, were also refurbished and reinstalled in the plaza. Pier A opened to the general public for the first time in history in 2014 as a visitor center, restaurant, and event space.]]></desc>

The former Downtown Athletic Club, built between 1929 and 1930, is one of Manhattan’s most distinctive art deco skyscrapers.
Designed by Starret & Van Vleck, the building is a rare example of a vertical clubhouse.
The irregular massing of the design reflects the shape and configuration of the original athletic facilities, which included a swimming pool, tennis courts, and miniature golf.
Since 1935, the club has sponsored the Heisman Memorial Trophy, awarded to the nation’s outstanding college football player.
The club closed in 2002 and the building was converted to the Downtown Club Condominium in 2005.]]></desc>

Once surrounded by farmland and orchards, this remote &#8220;country church&#8221; (belonging to the Parish of Trinity Church) accommodated parishioners living on the outskirts of town. With the addition of the steeple in 1794, many considered St. Paul’s the most elegant and imposing church edifice in the city.

    <desc><![CDATA[Nearby this spot, from the 1870s to the 1910s, stood the Haymarket, the
Moulin Rouge of New York's gilded age. A concert saloon, it was among
New York's first night clubs, when electricity first turned night into
day. The subject of a famous painting by John Sloan of the Ash Can
School, it tallied 5,000 visitors per day in 1903.<p>

It stood at the nexus of New York civilization when Madison Square was
the center of the city; where the theater, high end residential, and red
light districts all came together. It was feet away from the Great White
Way, when the theaters came up Broadway from Madison Square. Across
Broadway stand today the Gilsey House (1869), the Breslin Hotel (1904),
and the beginning of high end residential Fifth Avenue.<p>

A red light district in the Tenderloin (that reformists called Satan's
Circus) stretched along these side streets, west of Broadway from 24th
Street up the West Side. "A popular if not always proper resort in the
city,&#8221; the Haymarket's national notoriety was due in part to a policy of
not allowing the "business&#8221; of prostitutes, pimps, gangs, and thieves to
be conducted on the premises.<p>

In the 1910s it became a moviehouse run by William Fox, a former
garment worker, whose name is so widespread in the media today.<p>

Opened in 1914 by the Jesuits to provide a tuition-free liberal arts education to gifted Catholic men, Regis High School is an imposing five-story Classical Revival limestone building designed to harmonize in scale with the Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola across the street. Designed by a Boston firm that specialized in work for Roman Catholic institutions, the architects planned the building around a central courtyard to provide the quiet and seclusion deemed desirable for effective education. The high school, designated a New York City landmark in 1969, demonstrates the successful adaptation of Classical design to a modern building, and is one of the most dignified school buildings in the city.<br><br>

The New York Yacht Club building is one of the most expressive examples of Beaux-Arts architecture in the country. Dedicated in 1901, the clubhouse was the first New York City commission of architects Warren & Wetmore, establishing the firm’s distinguished reputation. The limestone façade of the New York Yacht Club is sculpted with nautical motifs featuring a trio of windows carved to resemble the sterns of seventeenth-century Dutch yachts, as well as ornamental seashells, dolphins and dripping seaweed. Constructed on land donated by Commodore J. Pierpont Morgan, the club’s sixth home has become a well-known symbol of the nation’s oldest yachting organization, in continuous existence since 1844. The celebrated America’s Cup, first won in 1851 by the schooner <i>America</i> in a regatta at Cowes, England, was deeded to the club in 1857.<br><br>

This handsome Beaux-Arts-style building was one of the first high-rise clubhouses constructed in New York City. Designed by Evarts Tracy and Egerton Swartwout as the Yale Club in 1900-01, the red brick façade features a rusticated limestone base with a profusion of terra-cotta ornament, including bands of ornamental relief, draped garlands, and foliated cartouches. Both architects had previously worked as draftsmen in the office of McKim Mead & White, and this building was likely their first independent commission. After 1915, it was home to the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, the Army & Navy Club of America, the U.S. Service maritime center, and Touro College. The trustees of the University of Pennsylvania acquired the structure in 1989 and the Penn Club opened in 1994.<br>

The first African-American woman to write a play performed on Broadway, Lorraine Hansberry is best known for <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> (1959), about a Chicago family living under racial segregation. The play’s title is taken from Langston’s Hughes’ poem <i>Harlem</i>, and some of its elements are taken from her parents’ life &#8211; their purchase of a home in a racially restricted Chicago neighborhood eventually culminated in the 1940 Supreme Court decision that restricted covenants could be legally contested. In 1950, Hansberry moved to NYC, where she attended the New School, wrote for Paul Robeson’s Pan-Africanist newspaper <i>Freedom</i>, and, in 1953, married producer Robert Nemiroff. Later involved with the nation’s first lesbian rights organization, The Daughters of Bilitis, Hansberry brought this building in 1960, where she resided until her death. Hansberry inspired Nina Simone’s 1969 song, <i> To Be Young, Gifted, and Black.</i><br><br>

In this building, the first female doctor in America, Elizabeth Blackwell, established the first hospital for, staffed, and run by women. The New York Infirmary for Women and Children opened on May 12, 1857, a date which was also the birthday of Blackwell's friend and collaborator Florence Nightingale. Groundbreaking at the time, the hospital provided free medical care for indigent women and children and offered clinical experience and instruction for women determined to expand their skills as physicians.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Woodrow Wilson "Woody&#8221; Guthrie, composer of <i>This Land Is Your Land</i>,
is considered a 'father' of American folk music. Known as "The Dust
Bowl Balladeer,&#8221; he was born in Okemah, Oklahoma, and spent years
traveling throughout the U.S., before moving to New York City in 1940.
Guthrie lived here, from December 1942 to May 1943, where he wrote
patriotic, anti-Fascist songs supporting the U.S. role in WWII, and
played music with such friends as blues icon Lead Belly; Sonny Terry
and Brownie McGhee. Guthrie helped popularize a new approach to 
songwriting, telling stories of hardship and hopes; where topics 
including workers' rights, social injustices, historic events, civil
rights, and political issues became the foundation for his
musical creativity and expression. He wrote more than
3000songs, and his influence has inspired generations
of musicians in every genre of music.]]></desc>

irregularly defined historic
districts, Greenwich Village
contains architecture from many
periods of New York history
and it is a world-wide byword
for artistic achievement and
"bohemian&#8221; lifestyles. A separate
village in the 18th century
the area boomed after New York
residents fled the 1793 yellow
fever epidemic raging on the
island's southern tip. The
gridiron plan for the growth of
Manhattan, developed in 1811,
marched around the Village's
irregular street pattern. Many of
the 19th century red brick
Federal-style, Greek Revival, and
later Italianate-style buildings
remain with insertions of late 19th
century tenements. Pre-World
War II apartment buildings thrust
through the low-rise domestic
skyline in places. Discovered as a
low-rent haven before World War I,
the Village has been home ever
since to artists and writers, and
today it attracts theater and media
celebrities, as well.]]></desc>

They feared invasion by England and her New England colonists. Later, they also worried about raids by Lenape Indians. Townsmen armed themselves and formed a militia to patrol the wall and guard their homes.<br><br>The wood-planked wall stood 9 feet high, and allowed soldiers to fire at invaders attacking from the northern countryside (today’s uptown). Two bastions were later topped with cannon to hold enemies at bay. Two gates, one here at De Heere Straet (Broadway) and one on the East River shore (Pearle Street), enabled settlers to enter and leave the town.<br><br>The street running along the wall’s south side was called Langs de Wal (Along the Wall). The wall stood until 1699, long after the English conquest of 1664. By its final years, the wall had fallen into disrepair, and townspeople had stripped it of many planks to use as firewood. Langs de Wal took a new name: Wall Street.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Located at the intersection of Oliver Street, East Broadway, the Bowery, and Park Row, Kimlau Square stands at the center of Chatham Square. In 1961, a local law named this island within Chatham Square in recognition of the contributions of Lt. Kimlau and the Lt. B.R. Kimlau Chinese Memorial Post 1291, founded by Chinese-American World War II veterans in 1945.<br><br>
Second Lieutenant Benjamin Ralph Kimlau (1918-1944) was a Chinese-American bomber pilot who died serving his country in World War II. Born in Concord, Massachusetts, Kimlau moved to New York City with his parents when he was fourteen. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1937, Kimlau first traveled to China, where he witnessed firsthand Japanese military aggression. The next year, he returned to the United States and entered the Pennsylvania Military College (Now the United States Army War College). Kimlau graduated with honors, earning a commission in the United States Army Field Artillery.<br><br>
Interested in airborne defense, Kimlau transferred from the Field Artillery to the United States Army Air Force. Following flight school, he was assigned to the &#8220;Flying Circus&#8221;, the 380th Bombardment Group of the Fifth Air Force in Australia. Beginning on February 27, 1944, along with four other pilots, Kimlau embarked on a mission to bomb Japanese airbases around New Guinea. On March 4, 1944, Kimlau and his fellow pilots were ordered to attack the Japanese near Los Negros, an island adjacent to New Guinea. During the attack, the Japanese defenders shot down the attacking U.S. bombers, killing Kimlau and the other pilots. For their heroism and devotion to duty on this occasion and several others, the members of the 380th Bombardment Group earned two Presidential Unit Citations.<br><br>
The Post gifted the Lt. Kimlau monument in 1961 with the renaming of the park. This memorial, designed by architect Poy G. Lee (1900-1968), is located at the head of Oliver Street and is reminiscent of a triumphal arch. The memorial stands eighteen feet nine inches in height and is sixteen feet wide. Inscribed on the memorial is a dedication in both English and Chinese: "In memory of the Americans of Chinese Ancestry who lost their Lives in Defense of Freedom and Democracy.&#8221;<br><br>
The largest in New York City, the Post continues to promote numerous patriotic programs and community service initiatives within Chinatown. They have established and contributed to a capital fund for the construction of a recreation center at the Chinese Community Center, published the American Legion’s first bilingual newsletter, and teach new immigrants basic English.<br><br>

built in 1911-12 to the design of Van Vleck & Goldsmith
for the American Railway Supply Co., a brass tags
manufacturing firm. The company was located in this
building until at least 1945. American Railway was selected
in 1932 to supply the "buttons and lapel insignia for
employees and badges for motormen, conductors,
guards and porters&#8221; of New York's subway system. The
Partition Servicing Co., manufacturer of metal partitions
and metal badge stampers, acquired the building in 1938.
The building was converted in 1965 into an art gallery
and residence for Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., the automobile
heir, who was also a leading art and artifacts collector.
At the time of the sale of his $100,000 stamp collection
in 1967, the New York Times mentioned that the sale
was consummated in a hideaway office Mr. Chrysler
maintains in New York.&#8221; Chrysler sold the property in
1973 to Alan Greenberg, the owner of an antiques business
on Bleecker Street. One of the later owners was the artist
Jennifer Bartlett. A third story was added to the structure
by architect Victor Caliandro in 1989.<p>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near West 14th Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The High Line was built by the New York Central Railroad between
1929 and 1934 to lift dangerous freight trains from Manhattan's
streets. Originally extending down to the St. John's Park Terminal
at Clarkson Street, the High Line was part of a much larger rail
infrastructure project called the West Side Improvement, which
eliminated street-level train crossings from Spuyten Duyvil
to Lower Manhattan. The High Line's trains carried meat, produce
and dairy products into warehouses and factories at the third-floor
level. It was known as the "Life Line of New York."<p>

For many years, the High Line was a vital part of the busy
manufacturing landscape of the industrial West Side. However,
as trucking began to replace rail as the primary means of moving
freight in New York City, train traffic declined on the High Line,
and the southernmost section was torn down. By 1980, the trains
had stopped running. What remained of the High line, from
Gansevoort Street to 34th Street, was slowly taken over by a
self-sown landscape, showing the power of nature to conquer
even monumental, man-made structures.<p>

In 1999, with the High Line threatened with demolition
neighborhood residents Joshua David and Robert Hammond
formed Friends of the High Line to advocate for the preservation
and reuse of the structure. In 2002, through the leadership of
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York City Council, the
City of New York boldly committed to transform the High Line into
a one-of-a-kind park. Innovative design was central to the vision
The goal was to create a public landscape as unusual and
unexpected as the High Line itself.<p>

Tens of thousands of people have been part of the High Line's
transformation. This park embodies their dedication to
New York City and their desire to make something wonderful
for future generations.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Dr. Gertrude B. Kelly (1862-1934), a pioneer
surgeon and philanthropist, was born
in Ireland and emigrated to the United
States in 1873. She studied at the Women's
Medical College of the New York Infirmary
for Women and Children, which was founded
by Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female
physician in the United States. Dr. Kelly's
direction of a clinic for the poor and her outspoken support for Irish independence made her a prominent figure in the Chelsea community. Kelly was also active in the women's suffrage movement and was a member of the Irish Women's Council. <p>

This parcel of land&#8212;located one hundred feet west of Ninth Avenue between 16th Street and 17th Street&#8212;was granted to the Public School Society in 1853. It was the site of old P.S. 11 until 1933 when the school was demolished, and a new building was erected on 21st Street. Jurisdiction of the property then passed to the Department of Parks. In 1934, the site was developed as one of five &#8220;model playgrounds&#8221; in the five boroughs. According to a press release issued by Parks, &#8220;Model playgrounds were built in five congested neighborhoods, and demonstrated the use of small areas for recreational purposes. These playgrounds were designed and equipped to meet the present-day needs of the children, and to enable directors to conduct a wide range of activities with a minimal amount of supervision.&#8221;<p>

On August 11, 1934, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses presided as Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia delivered an address to open this playground and ten others throughout the city via radio broadcast on WNYC, WNEW, and WOV. Following the speech the American flag was raised simultaneously at the various playgrounds. Every park but one was outfitted with a standard list of features: play house, flagpole, chlorinated footbath, wading pool, handball and basketball courts, play equipment, drinking fountains, shade trees, and shrubs.<p>

Plans were drawn up in 1966 to remove the wading pool and add new play equipment, such as a helical slide and arch climbers. New curvilinear walls softened the harsh angles of the playground. In 1975, the comfort station was reconstructed and in 1984 a renovation project focused on the east half of the park to provide new handball and basketball courts, showers, play equipment, community planting bed, and a rectilinear sitting area to the southeast.<p>

In 1998-99, the playground was reconstructed expanding the sitting area on the west side and upgrading benches, lighting, pavement, plantings, and drainage systems. A spray shower decorated with three elements paying tribute to Dr. Kelly was added. Clover leaves and a Celtic-styled dog represent Kelly’s place of birth, while her career was symbolized by the caduceus: two snakes twined around a staff, an ancient Greek emblem adopted by the medical profession.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The <i>William Tecumseh Sherman</i> monument by August Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907) was the artist’s last major monument and his crowning achievement. Architect Charles McKim designed the granite base for the monument and Saint-Gaudens brought on Alexander Phimister Proctor, a sculptor known for his depictions of animals, to sculpt the horse.<br><br>

The monument depicts the distinguished Civil War general (1820-1891) on his horse, led by a winged female figure personifying victory and celebrates Sherman’s victorious southern campaigns. Sherman appears stoic and pensive as he pulls on the reins of his horse, whose back hoof steps on pine cones and boughs, a reference to the landscape of the south,. He is propelled forward by Victory, who holds a palm frond and wears a crown of laurels, both symbols traditionally associated with her.<br><br>

The monument is made of bronze and covered in gold leaf. Saint-Gaudens used this treatment, unusual for outdoor sculpture, because he disliked the way bronze monuments developed a dark patina. By using gold, with a pigment to accentuate the details, he intended to ensure that the monument would remain luminous over time. The monument was conserved and re-gilded in 2014, as part of the Central Park Conservancy’s project to reconstruct Grand Army Plaza.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[From early Dutch times the tip of Manhattan was fortified with the batteries of guns from which the Battery takes its name &#8211; first at the 17th-century Fort Amsterdam on the Custom House site, then at Castle Clinton. Fort Amsterdam disappeared long ago, but its rubble survives in the layers of landfill that eventually helped create 23 acres of Battery Park, in the process filling in the water separating Castle Clinton from the mainland. Today, The Battery Conservancy is implementing its award-winning Master Plan to recapture the park’s harbor-side splendor.<br><br>Completed in 1811, as part of New York City’s harbor defense, Castle Clinton is among the oldest, most visited public buildings in Downtown. Transformed in 1824 into Castle Garden, showcasing balloonists, fireworks, and Italian opera companies, the former fort became the city’s leading place of entertainment, and its preferred location for grand entrances by visiting celebrities. From 1855 until 1890 Castle Garden served as America’s first official landing depot for new immigrants, &#8220;so well known in Europe,&#8221; according to the New York Times in 1874, &#8220;that few immigrants could be induced to sail for any other destination.&#8221;<br><br>From 1896 to 1941, Castle Garden served as the New York Aquarium, in its day the world’s largest. 100 wall tanks and 7 large pools played home to 8,000 creatures including turtles, sea lions, sturgeon, alligators, crocodiles, manatees, porpoises, beavers, seacows, electric eels, and whales, many living in salt water pumped in from New York Bay.<br><br>Today, Castle Clinton is a National Monument operated by the National Park Service.]]></desc>

The design that Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux conceived for Central park transformed the rocky, marshy pre-park site into a masterful composition of diverse landscapes to create an idealized expression of rural scenery. These included picturesque woods, serene lakes and ponds, and the landscape type most closely associated with the Park and its creators &#8211; pastoral meadows. Meadows figured prominently in Olmsted’s and Vaux’s vision for the Park, as reflected in the title of their winning competition entry for its design, which they called simply, &#8220;Greensward.&#8221;<br>
The park’s designers were focused on the uplifting effect that the scenic quality of meadows would have on the human spirit. But meadows have additional value beyond the psychological effects Olmsted and Vaux emphasized.<br>
Landscapes planted with native grasses and wildflowers produce ecological and environmental benefits. In addition to supporting a broader diversity of wildlife, they can be a practical, sustainable treatment for certain landscape types, once native grasses are established at sufficient height to prevent self-seeding invasive species and obviate the need for mowing.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Peregrine Falcons in New York City<br><br>
Pairs of peregrine falcons have been found nesting on the window ledges of such buildings as the Metropolitan Life Building, adjacent to this parkland. The reemergence of the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in North America is one of the environmental movement’s greatest success stories. Until the middle of the 20th century, the crow-sized, dark-capped, blue-gray peregrines ruled the skies and rocky mountaintops from Alaska all the way to Georgia, preying on smaller birds such as sparrows and pigeons. One of nature’s most skilled hunters, the peregrine falcon dive-bombs its prey at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. Capable of flying at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour in level flight, the peregrine is one of the world’s faster birds.<br><br>
But in the 1950s and ‘60s, the chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), was used widely in agricultural pesticides, found its way up the food chain. The sparrows, pigeons, and other small birds that peregrines hunted fed on insects contaminated with DDT. Through a process known as biomagnification, DDT accumulated in the peregrines, causing their eggs to become too weak to even support the weight of the mother incubating her eggs. The eggs shattered before fledglings could hatch. By the time DDT was finally banned in 1972, there was not a single peregrine left east of the Mississippi.<br><br>
When the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, peregrine falcons were one of the first species to receive protection. restoration efforts were launched throughout the 1970s and ‘80s; during that time, 150 young captivity-bred Peale’s peregrine falcons (the eastern peregrine subspecies being extinct) were released in New York State, to reclaim nesting sites in the rocky peaks and crags of the Adirondacks and Hudson River Palisades.<br><br>
Over the years, peregrines have moved farther and farther into New York City, taking up residences on the exteriors of skyscrapers and bridges. Pairs of peregrine falcons have also been found high up on the Bank of New York (48 Wall Street), and the St. Regis Hotel (2 East 55th Street) in Manhattan. In addition to the Verrazano Narrows and Throgs Neck bridges, peregrines have been seen on the Manhattan tower of the Brooklyn Bridge, as well as an old gun turret on the Marine Parkway. These manmade aeries provide perfect residences for the birds &#8211; isolated, easily approachable by air, and with great views of territory and of prey.<br><br>
By 1999, the peregrine falcon had recovered sufficiently to be moved off the Endangered Species List. Over 145 falcons have been successfully hatched and banded by biologists in New York City since 1983, and have been found raising their own families as far away as Baltimore and Wisconsin.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[History of New Pier One<br><br>
New Pier 1 was designed by General George B. Mc Clellan (of Civil War Fame), first Engineer-in-Chief of the Department of Docks. It was constructed between 1872 and 1877 as part of a larger maritime complex that included a wharf and boat landing.<br><br>
The pier was later leased to the Iron Steam-Boat Company, which ran ferries to Coney Island beginning in 1881. The Steam-Boat Company erected a two-story pier building to house a restaurant, a saloon, and a dance hall. By 1897, New Pier 1 was turned over to freight use, and in 1972, it was demolished to make way for Battery Park City.<br><br>
The white granite inlay in the pavement of this plaza indicates the approximate location of New Pier 1 and the shorelines circa 1877 and 1886. This map shows New Pier 1 of the far left circa 1879. The water around these piers was infilled in the early 1970s to create Battery Park City, so the former site of New Pier 1 is now largely within the footprint of Robert F. Wagner Park.]]></desc>

Septuagesimo Uno (meaning seventy-one in Latin) is located on 71st Street between West End and Amsterdam Avenues. The parkland lies within the area settled following the Commissioners Plan of 1811. New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton (1769-1828) created the commission, which was charged with planning the orderly development of Manhattan north of Houston Street. Prominent New Yorkers, such as the politician Gouveneur Morris (1752-1816), the surveyor Simeon DeWitt (1756-1834), and the lawyer John Rutherford (1760-1840), filled the commission’s ranks. The planners agreed on a system, of rectangular blocks, extending from 14th Street through Washington Heights, designed to maximize the city’s efficiency and ease of use. Known as the &#8220;grid system&#8221;, the plan arranged 12 North-South avenues perpendicular to 155 East-West cross streets. The commission designed the avenues to be 100 feet wide and the streets to lie 200 feet apart. The plan provided for parks to be located on 53rd, 66th, 77th, and 120th Streets. Latter additions included Union, Tompkins, Stuyvesant, and Madison Squares as well as Lexington and Madison Avenues.<br><br>
The Commissioners Plan of 1811 astutely predicted the exponential residential growth that would occur during the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the plan failed to include the park acreage necessary to provide adequate recreation for the growing population. By the 1960’s, land had become extremely scarce in New York City. Recognizing this scarcity, the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay (1921-2000) began the Vest Pocket Park campaign in New York City. Vest pocket parks, like Septuagesimo Uno, are most often constructed on small vacant lots between buildings. City, state, or federal governments fund the creation of these parks, which community residents uses until they are developed. In many cases, community organizations and charitable groups petition for the construction of these parks. Vest pocket parks are located in densely populated neighborhoods and characterized by sitting area, gardens, and playgrounds. <br><br>
New York City acquired this property through condemnation on March 28, 1969. Mayor Lindsay’s Vest Pocket Park initiative supervised the landscaping of the parcel. In May 1981, The Department of General Services transferred jurisdiction of the property to Parks. Based on the agreement, Parks developed a sitting area and maintains the site in cooperation with Community Board 7. Suptuagesimo Uno boasts several benches that are surrounded by well-maintained gardens. <br><br>

&#8220;In 2000, the park received a $14,325 renovation sponsored by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The improvements included the addition of steel fencing with bear claw extensions. At night. the fences are closed to deter vandalism. For the millennium, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern spiced up the park’s bland name, &#8220;71st Street Plot&#8221; by giving it its present Latin appellation.<br>

Designed by architect Emery Roth and completed in 1930, the San Remo was the first twin-towered residential skyscraper built on Central Park West. A graceful fusion of modern and traditional forms, the building is considered to be among Roth’s finest works. Its towers soar twenty-seven stories above the street; crowning each tower is a roman-style Corinthian temple topped by a twenty-two foot copper lantern. Italian Renaissance details in terra-cotta, metal and limestone embellish the façade. Similar details are carried into the building’s handsome lobbies, together with its twin-towered neighbors to the north and south, the San Remo anchors the magnificent Central Park West skyline.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>In September 1609, Henry Hudson and some 20 seamen sailed their ship, the <i>Halve Maen</i> (Half Moon), into what is today New York harbor. The Dutch East India Company expected Hudson to find a passage to Asia. Instead, his voyage allowed the Dutch to claim a territory they would call Nieuw Nederland &#8211; today parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Connecticut. In 1625-26, the new Dutch West India Company established an outpost here at Manhattan’s tip to function as the colony’s capital and trading center. They called the town Nieuw Amsterdam. It would become New York City.<br><br>Between 1625 and 1664, Nieuw Amsterdam became a thriving community of some 2,000 merchants, craftsmen, shopkeepers, farmers, laborers, slaves, and families. Walloon, Flemish, French, German, Bohemian, British, Scandinavian, and Jewish migrants joined Dutch settlers. The houses, canals, and windmills built here put a Dutch imprint on the land. In 1664, and English fleet conquered the colony in the name of the Duke of York. But Dutch cultural traditions, and the town’s early ethnic and religious diversity, continued to shape New York’s history and identity.<br><br>The Dutch legacy in New York was complex. The Dutch traded with Indians, but also fought them. They imported enslaved Africans to toil for them, but also allowed some to gain freedom and own land. Jewish refugees settled, but Director-General Petrus Stuyvesant granted them rights only after authorities in the Netherlands ordered him to do so. Through conflict and compromise, the Dutch established a community that over time would become one of the world’s great cities.<br><br>In celebration of Hudson’s voyage of discovery 400 years ago, this self guided walking tour will take you to 12 sites in lower Manhattan that were important in the daily life of Dutch Nieuw Amsterdam. The map shows the location of each of these sites, where you will find a sign explaining its history.<br><br><b> < <i>Sidebar:</i> ><br>FORT AMSTERDAM<br>Location:</b> Bowling Green between State & Whitehall Streets<br><b>Dutch Name:</b> De Heere Wegh at Het Marckvelt<br><br>Fort Amsterdam was the focal point for the tiny community of settlers who crossed the Atlantic to make their homes in Nieuw Nederland in 1624, 15 years after Hudson’s voyage. The Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam scattered its first colonists &#8211; 30 Walloon families &#8211; to outposts at Fort Orange (today’s Albany), the Delaware and Connecticut Rivers, and Governors Island in New York harbor. But Company agents decided to establish headquarters on Manhattan. In 1625-26, a Dutch engineer supervised the planning of Fort Amsterdam at the island’s tip. The town that grew up around the fort was named Nieuw Amsterdam.<br><br>Built of earth and maintained by European laborers and enslaved Africans, the fort’s walls loomed over the town’s dirt roads, houses, and harbor. A director appointed by the Company ran the colony from the fort. He also commanded a garrison of soldiers to repel possible attacks by Spain, France, England, or hostile native peoples.<br><br>The fort was the nerve center of Nieuw Amsterdam, and of the colony of Nieuw Nederland which stretched deep into the countryside. Here, in 1664, Director-General Petrus Stuyvesant reluctantly surrendered to an English fleet threatening to destroy the town. Nieuw Amsterdam became New York City, and the colony of Nieuw Nederland became New York and New Jersey.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near William Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The Queen Elizabeth II September 11th Garden<br>
Hanover Square<br><br>
Within the shady recesses of New York’s financial district is a garden commissioned by the British Memorial Garden Trust and given to the city in memory of British and Commonwealth citizens who lost their lives during the attack of September 11 2001 and in the ensuing wars.<br><br>
The garden was developed from a plan by English landscape designers Julian and Isabel Bannerman. It combines this park’s footprint with the shape of the British Isles, wrapping the plantings with a ribbon of Morayshire sandstone quarried from the highlands of Scotland. A geography lesson, this ribbon of stone is inscribed from north to south with the shires of the British Isles from Aberdeen to Portland. The large rounded ‘Braenar’ stone, from a riverbed near the HM The Queen’s home in Balmoral, sits at the south end of the garden &#8211; in the spirit of a cairn, marking the distance from Aberdeen.<br><br>
Here the rich tradition of English gardens meets the urban American landscape. New York based garden designers Lynden B. Miller and Ronda M. brands worked on the Bannerman design to create an enduring garden for all seasons, with plants the capture the spirit of an English garden.<br><br>
The four evergreen hollies (<i>Ilex x aquipernyi ‘Dragon Lady’</i>), cultivars derived from an English holly parent, stand as entry pillars at the north and south ends of the garden. They are linked to the vertical spires of Sky Pencil hollies (<i>Ilex crenata</i> ‘Sky Pencil’) by a widening row of 67 nandinas (<i>Nandina domestica </i> Gulf Stream’), evergreen shrubs with foliage that turns red and orange in the colder months, each signifying one of the 67 British victims of 9/11. Along the backs of the serpentine benches &#8211; made of white Portland stone quarried in southern England and carved in Northern Ireland &#8211; are rounded yew shrubs (<i>Taxus x media ‘Brownii’</i>), long-lived evergreens and an iconic feature of English churchyards, embodying the natural link between the living and the dead. These plants are the backbone of the garden, suggesting the narrative that led to its making.<br><br>
Nested within is a range of herbaceous and woody flowering plants that recall the plant palette of an English garden, ranging from the tiny blue flower of the Siberian bugloss (<i>Brunnera macrophylla</i>) and the pink blossom of the pigsqueak (<i>Bergania cordifolia </i>’Bressingham Ruby’) to a host of hydrangeas, spireas, rhododendrons and azeleas. The flowering lady’s mantle (<i>Alchemilla mollis</i>), a native of Europe and often found in English gardens, bears lime-green florets in early summer. At the southern reach of the planting beds &#8211; where the nardina ribbon ends &#8211; rises a yellow magnolia, fortuitously called Magnolia ‘Elizabeth’. The garden’s namesake HM, The Queen Elizabeth II visited this living memorial on July 6, 2010. The Magnolia ‘Elizabeth’, patented at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in 1977, was planted by her grandson HRH Prince Harry on May 29, 2009. With fragrant yellow flowers, it is an early bloomer, catching the first rays of spring light as the sun rises over the tops of the skyscrapers and into the garden.<br><br>
Along the periphery and upon the slate walk are reminiscences of the Commonwealth, planted here to be read like mementos of friendship between the Americans and the British. The four national flowers of the British isles &#8211; rose for England, daffodil for Wales, thistle for Scotland and flax for Northern Ireland &#8211; are embossed on the finials the top the Eastern Memorial fence.<br><br>
Gardens can be read like letters, each flower capturing a part of a human story. Here amongst the quarried stone and plantings, sent from the English to the Americans in a time of mutual loss, this garden can be read and reread in the days after, remembering, healing, and ever cultivating.<br><br>]]></desc>

Designed by the renowned architectural firm of Cross & Cross, this 1929-1931 Art Deco Building is one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era. It was constructed as the headquarters for the RCA Corporation but was deeded to the General Electric Company prior to its completion. The octagonal brick-clad tower rises fifty stories from a rounded corner. Complex multi-colored brickwork and terra cotta, carved red marble detail, and nickel-silver ornamentation are especially noteworthy. The stylized figures at the tower’s crown are an allegory of the &#8220;wireless communications&#8221;. An award-winning restoration of the building was undertaken in 1994-1996 as a joint venture of Columbia University, G. Soros Realty, and the Mendik Company under the direction of WCA Design Group, Inc.<br><br>

A printmaker, illustrator, and prominent watercolorist, Hopper is renowned for his oil paintings, whose focus on everyday life explores the visualization of human isolation, regret and boredom. His most famous painting, <i>Nighthawks</i> (1942), shows customers at a brightly-lit all-night diner, inspired by a local Village restaurant. Many of Hopper’s canvases focus on solitary figures or couples in their everyday environments; his rural landscapes and marine paintings were inspired by the area around Truro, Massachusetts, where he summered for nearly 40 years. Hopper developed a consistent style of modern painting that remained realist, despite the dominance of abstraction in art during much of his life. Though he had no formal students, many artists including de Kooning and Rothko, have cited him as an influence. From 1913 until his death, Edward Hopper shared this studio with his wife, Jo, who was also a painter, his only model, and his muse.<br><br>

Edward Clark, heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune and owner of much land on the Upper West Side, collaborated with Henry J. Hardenbergh, architect of the nearby Dakota Apartments (1884), the city’s first luxury apartment house. A year later Clark commissioned Hardenbergh to build the row of houses on West 73rd Street, which once extended unbroken from 15A to 67 West 73rd Street. The Neo-Georgian row houses on West 74th Street, built in 1905 by architect Percy Griffin, were roomy luxury houses with an innovative bathroom for each bedroom. The Langham on Central Park West (1907) is a grand Beaux-Arts building in the style of the day, complementing the smaller-scale elegance and dignity of the Side Streets.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>In September 1609, Henry Hudson and some 20 seamen sailed their ship, the <i>Halve Maen</i> (Half Moon), into what is today New York harbor. The Dutch East India Company expected Hudson to find a passage to Asia. Instead, his voyage allowed the Dutch to claim a territory they would call Nieuw Nederland &#8211; today parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Connecticut. In 1625-26, the new Dutch West India Company established an outpost here at Manhattan’s tip to function as the colony’s capital and trading center. They called the town Nieuw Amsterdam. It would become New York City.<br><br>Between 1625 and 1664, Nieuw Amsterdam became a thriving community of some 2,000 merchants, craftsmen, shopkeepers, farmers, laborers, slaves, and families. Walloon, Flemish, French, German, Bohemian, British, Scandinavian, and Jewish migrants joined Dutch settlers. The houses, canals, and windmills built here put a Dutch imprint on the land. In 1664, and English fleet conquered the colony in the name of the Duke of York. But Dutch cultural traditions, and the town’s early ethnic and religious diversity, continued to shape New York’s history and identity.<br><br>The Dutch legacy in New York was complex. The Dutch traded with Indians, but also fought them. They imported enslaved Africans to toil for them, but also allowed some to gain freedom and own land. Jewish refugees settled, but Director-General Petrus Stuyvesant granted them rights only after authorities in the Netherlands ordered him to do so. Through conflict and compromise, the Dutch established a community that over time would become one of the world’s great cities.<br><br>In celebration of Hudson’s voyage of discovery 400 years ago, this self guided walking tour will take you to 12 sites in lower Manhattan that were important in the daily life of Dutch Nieuw Amsterdam. The map shows the location of each of these sites, where you will find a sign explaining its history.<br><br><b> < <i>Sidebar:</i> ><br>WINDMILL<br>Location:</b>   City Hall Park<br><b>Dutch Name:</b>   Buyten de Landtpoort (Beyond the Land Gate)<br><br>One of the most familiar features of the Dutch landscape that colonists brought with them was the windmill. One such mill, built by carpenters near this spot in 1663-64, replaced an earlier one first erected before 1628 along the Beaver’s Path at Manhattan’s tip. The windmill here, on the &#8220;common lands&#8221; outside the city limits, continued to grind flour after the English took Nieuw Amsterdam from the Dutch in 1664.<br><br>Windmills were highly functional structures, turning wheat and rye grown by Dutch settlers into flour for bread, cakes, and the sweets known as koeckjes &#8211; a word that later entered New Yorkers’ vocabulary as &#8220;cookies.&#8221; Mills also ground the grain used to brew beer, one of Nieuw Amsterdam’s favorite beverages. Mills thus became important in the local economy, as farmers who had settled in the countryside of upper Manhattan and Long Island brought their crops for milling.]]></desc>

A footpath brought Dutch &#8220;maidens&#8221; to wash laundry in the stream’s fresh water. By 1658 this was known as ‘t Maagde Paatje, the maidens’ path. After the English took over in 1664, it became &#8220;Maiden Lane.&#8221; When New York City expanded northward above Wall Street and the stream was covered over, the name stayed when the path became an urban street.<br><br>Cleanliness was a central value in Dutch culture. In the Netherlands, rich merchants hired poor and peasant women as servants to do the wash and other household work. Some young women emigrated to Nieuw Amsterdam after signing contracts to work as family servants. Dutch settlers also used enslaved Africans as domestic laborers. In many cases, family members shared household toil. Though the Dutch allowed females legal and economic rights denied them elsewhere in Europe, gender roles still dictated that women and girls perform most domestic labor. So Nieuw Amsterdam’s &#8220;maidens&#8221; found themselves here, doing the family laundry.]]></desc>

The canal stretched from near today’s Exchange Place to the East River shore at Pearl Street. Townspeople built bridges crossing it at what are now Beaver Street, Stone Street, and Bridge Street. The canal provided security against fires, bringing a supply of water into the heart of the town.<br><br>Canals were a key feature of the landscape in the Netherlands, where waterways allowed passengers and cargoes to travel through busy cities. The name of this modest channel was taken from the Heere Gracht in Amsterdam, one of Europe’s grandest canals, lined with the mansions of rich merchants.<br><br>Some of the town’s notable institutions lined the street running along the canal. These included the elementary school, the Latin school for older students, and the deacon’s house for the poor, one of New York’s first social services. But the canal gradually became a polluted nuisance. In 1676 it was filled in and became the street you see today.]]></desc>

Taverns were lively centers of social life in the Netherlands, and Dutch settlers carried the tradition across the Atlantic. Entrepreneurs like Rees sold rum and wine imported from the Caribbean and Europe, as well as locally-brewed beer. Drunkenness and tavern violence were problems in Nieuw Amsterdam. In 1663, Rees was taken to court for not reporting a brawl in which his customer Denys Isaacksen stabbed Pieter Jansen, a mason. He was also charged with breaking the law by selling beer during Sunday church hours. But the city court dismissed charges against him, and Rees apparently stayed in business.<br><br>Taverns or &#8220;taprooms&#8221; also played other roles for townspeople. Men and women came to play ninepins and backgammon, and to share gossip and news. Taverns were settings for business deals and public meetings. The beer that taverns sold earned money for local farmers, millers, and brewers. As with their windmills, canals, and houses, the Dutch imported their taverns to ease life in the New World.]]></desc>

Built in 1923 by the well-known architect Donn Barber, this building was revolutionary in many ways. Instead of placing the trading floor at street level, Barber placed it at the top. He canopied it with a large skylight and three-story windows, affording natural light, fresh air, and giving commanding views of the ships that carried King Cotton into New York City. The barrel vaulting of the lobby was designed by the famous Gustavino Tile Company, and Barber’s bold geometric symbols for cotton adorn the building. In 1984 the Cotton Exchange was the first major building in the Financial District to be converted into residential use as a co-op and it is now in The National Register of Historic Places.]]></desc>

55 Wall Street was designed by prominent Boston Architect Isaiah Rogers and constructed between 1836 and 1842. The façade of the original four-story, Greek Revival style building features twelve massive Ionic columns, each a single block of Quincy granite. In 1899, First National Bank, which subsequently became Citibank, commissioned architects McKim, Mead and White to remodel the building for use as their headquarters. The architects added four stories to the building and superimposed a second colonnade of Corinthian columns above the original façade. They also redesigned the interior into an immense banking hall featuring a sixty-foot-high central dome and offices at each corner. Sold in the mid-1980s, the former bank building became the Regent Wall Street Hotel in 1999. After the terrorist attack on the World Trade center on September 11, 2001, 55 Wall Street served as a relief center for workers and area residents.<br><br>

The enormous Ionic columns supporting the lower level of the Merchant’s Exchange at 55 Wall Street, each cut from a single piece of stone and weighing 45 tons, were floated on rafts from a quarry in Massachusetts and hauled to the site by 40 teams of oxen. The original Merchants Exchange had been founded in 1823 as a convenient gathering spot for the young city’s busy merchants, where they could simply find each other and make their deals. The new Exchange, built to replace he original after its destruction in the Great Fire of 1835, housed a rotunda large enough to hold 3,000 dickering merchants, Over the years, the building served as home to the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Chamber of Commerce and the Unites States Customs House, before being acquired by First National Bank. So taken was the bank’s president with the Wall Street history of the Exchange, that instead of replacing it, he retained McKim, Mead & White to double its size with a second colonnade in 1907.<br><br>

Cross & Cross, architects, 1931<br><br>
A magnificent skyscraper that hoped to be the world’s tallest, the City Bank-Farmers Trust Company tower became one of the great spires of the downtown skyline. The enormous new building was created by the National City Bank (predecessor of today’s Citibank), which, from its nine-story classical home at 55 Wall Street, engineered a merger with Farmers Trust Company, and bridged across Exchange Place to build its new skyscraper headquarters. The building’s massive, irregularly shaped base of granite and limestone sits like an impregnable financial fortress on narrow Exchange Place, while above it rises a slender, square tower, designed primarily for its romantic presence in the skyline.<br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The Archaeology of the Stadt Huys Block<br><br>
The Excavation of the Stadt Huys Block<br>
The first large scale archeological excavation in New York City was conducted on this block in 1979-80. The excavation yielded important cultural material from the 17th through 19th centuries, proving that significant archeological deposits can be found in heavily developed urban areas. A number of wells, privies (or outhouses) and cisterns from the backyards of early houses, and the foundations and associated materials from the Lovelace Tavern were discovered. Excavations under Stone Street also uncovered a series of earth surfaces dating from the 17th through 19th centuries.<br><br>
The archeological exhibit in the plaza includes information about the Stadt Huys, Governor Lovelace’s Tavern, an 18th century well, and Stone Street, a 17th century thoroughfare. Their locations are indicated on the map above. The illustration below, derived from the 17th century Danckaerts’ View of lower Manhattan, shows the facades of the buildings on the Stadt Huys Block in 1679. The present day Pearl Street represents the approximate 17th century shoreline of the East River. The outline of Stone Street, now covered by 85 Broad Street, is preserved by the alignment of the lobby<br><br>
Governor Lovelace’s Tavern<br>
The Lovelace Tavern was built in 1670 under the direction of Francis Lovelace, the second English Governor of New York, and remained in use until 1706, when it was torn down. It was owned by the British Crown and served as a temporary city hall for a short time after 1697, when the first City Hall, the Stadt Huys, was declared unsafe for use. The archeological excavation uncovered parts of the tavern’s foundation wall, which are displayed here. The approximate location of the rest of the tavern’s walls are indicated by the gray paving stones. The excavation of the basement of the tavern disclosed many clay tobacco pipes and wine bottle fragments, indicating its use as a center of local social life.<br><br>
The tavern was relatedly large, built with its broad main façade along Pearl Street and a small extension to the rear. It is the second building from the right (Number 1) on the Danckaerts’ View (1679) below.<br><br>
The Stadt Huys<br>
The Stadt Huys, or Dutch City Hall, was built as a tavern , the Stadt Herberg (or City Inn), in 1641 by Director-General Kieft of the Dutch West India Company. When New Amsterdam became a municipality in 1653, the tavern was designated for use as the first City Hall, making it the center of governmental and political life in the Colony. It continued to serve this municipal function under both Dutch and English rule until it was declared unsafe for use in 1697, and was later torn down. The city government then convened at several taverns, including the adjoining Lovelace Tavern, until the new City Hall was built at the northeast corner of Wall and Nassau Streets in 1699.<br>
The Stadt Huys was built in a typical 17th century Dutch style with a stepped gable. In the 17th century, the Stadt Huys was one of the largest public buildings in the city. The approximate outline of this structure is indicated by the cream-colored paving. It is the first building on the right (Number 2) on the Duncker’s’ View (1670), below.<br><br>
An Eighteenth Century Well<br>
This well dates from the first third of the 18th century. It was located on property which belonged to the Phillippe family, of Phillipse Manor, one of the prominent families in colonial New York. The property remained in the family until the Revolutionary War, when it was confiscated by the new American government because of the family’s Loyalist sympathies. This well originally extended down to the water table, providing water for the inhabitants of the block. It is lined with arc-shaped bricks, and was found only a few yards from another well, lined with a barrel, which dates from the 17th century. Wells and other backyard structures, such as privies and cisterns, were often used for garbage disposal when they were no longer in use. This makes them valuable for archeologists, as they frequently contain large quantities of materials, such a mugs and plates, discarded from everyday life. This particular well contained a large amount of 18th century household refuse. (Number 3)]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Trinity Place, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Edgar Street Greenstreet<br><br>
This triangular greenstreet &#8211; a landscaped traffic island &#8211; stands at the southern juncture of Trinity Place and Greenwich Street a few blocks southwest of Trinity Church in lower Manhattan. It takes its name from the adjacent street to the north, Edgar Street, reputedly the shortest street in Manhattan. With the upheaval of the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, when the Trinity Place exit was completed in 1953, Edgar Street was pushed 30 feet north and widened from about 18 to 65 feet. The original footprint of the street now lies beneath this island.<br><br>
Well before it was codified on the city map, Edgar Street served as a passageway between the Hudson River shoreline and Trinity Place. Its gentle downward slope, also visible in the surrounding east/west streets, is the vestige of a ridge or bluff that ran parallel with the shoreline and crested at about Broadway, where Trinity Church is sited. It was a narrow street in its early days, no more than eighteen feet wide, called &#8220;Tuyn Paat&#8221; or &#8220;Golden Alley&#8221; in the Dutch period (1624-1664). When the British took command of the colony in 1664, the street name was changed with characteristic indifference to Tin Pot Alley.<br><br>
The City acquired the street in 1795, at which time the current street name was affixed. Edgar likely refers to the family of William Edgar (1736-1820), a merchant from Detroit who came to New York circa 1780 and established a successful shipping business, with links to India and China. For a time, the street served as a thoroughfare or driveway leading to the Edgar family household located nearby. Until the western shoreline was filled in, this street ran to or very near the water’s edge.<br><br>
The line of Greenwich Street was the approximate original coastline of Manhattan island. After the Revolutionary War (1775-1783), in 1787, the Common Council, a local legislature and the progeny of the City Council, acted on a pre-war proposal to expand the shoreline sixty feet to the Hudson River. Then began the construction of Greenwich Street, which soon hosted a row of Federal-style townhouses, of which the Dickey residence (1809-10) directly north of this greenstreet at 67 Greenwich Street is a remnant. Washington Street followed in approximately 1808 and West Street by 1830. The drop in grade from Broadway to Greenwich Street abruptly evens out where the landfill begins.<br><br>
In 2013 the Washington Street Historical Society adopted this greenstreet in support of Parks reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Sandy of 2012. Inspired by the rich history of the local area, members of the society, including Americans of Lebanese and Syrian descent, also dedicated bench plaques inscribed with the names of Arab-American individuals and groups from ‘Little Syria’, a thriving community of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br><br>
With sculptural junipers surrounding the benches, a small piazza surrounds a central planting area with oak leaf hydrangeas, viburnums and river birch trees. Hints of an earlier landscape and the people who settled here can be found in the streets encircling this greenstreet.<br><br>

The American Stock Exchange traced its roots to the late 1790s. Throughout the 1800s, ambitious businessmen gathered on the curb at Wall and Broad streets to trade securities issued by the U.S. Government, as well as by the railroad, shipping and mining companies that financed the westward expansion of the young and growing country.<br><br>
The New York Curb, as it was initially known, specialized in securities of these growth-oriented, entrepreneural companies &#8211; much as the American Stock Exchange does today. Hardy brokers stood out on The Curb in all kinds of weather, while their clerks balanced precariously in the windows of the office buildings above them. Since they could scarcely be heard over the surrounding din, brokers and their clerks developed a system of hand signals to communicate orders back and forth, and brokers wore brightly colored jackets and unusual hats so their clerks could easily locate them in the busy trading crowds.<br><br>
In 1921, the members of the New York Curb marched indoors to their facility at 86 Trinity Place to the strains of &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; &#8211; and a new era of securities trading, technological development and service to public investors began. In 1953, the Curb Market became the American Stock Exchange.<br><br>
The exchange was acquired by NYSE Euronext in 2008, and the trading floor at 86 Trinity Place was closed.]]></desc>

Designed by the noted theater architects, Herts & Tallant, for producers Klan & Erlanger, the New Amsterdam opened on October 26, 1903, with a production of Shakespeare’s <i>A Midsummer’s Night Dream</i>. The theater has one of the finest Art Nouveau interiors in the United States. As one of New York City’s best musical comedy houses, the New Amsterdam showcased many talented stars and was home to the Ziegfeld Follies from 1913 through 1927. The theatre, converted to a movie house in 1937, closed in 1988. The New Amsterdam was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Following acquisition by the 42nd Street Development Project, Inc. and the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the New Amsterdam was restored to its original splendor by the Walt Disney Company, who jointly funded the project with the Empire State Development Corporation, The New York City Economic Development Corporation, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The theater reopened in 1997.]]></desc>

From 1785 to 1790, New York served as the first capital of the brand-new United States of America. It was in Federal Hall that Congress met for the first time, adopted the Bill of Rights, and created the Departments of State, War and Treasury, and the United States Supreme Court.

The English took over the Dutch colony in 1664, and New Amsterdam became New York. But the Dutch roots still thrive. Peter Minuit and his compatriots set Manhattan on course as a melting pot and business hub. The settlers weren’t motivated by lofty ideals. There was a policy of tolerance, but also refusal to adhere to it. Their society didn’t have the neat outline that spawned the Puritan myth in New England.<br><br>
Yet what the settlers planted here may matter more now than ever. The terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center and shook the world in September 2001 struck not only the center of American finance but also the few acres of lower Manhattan that were once New Amsterdam. The fact that one grew out of the other ought to be proof that the idea of tolerance remains a thing of power. Developing it, showing that it could work, was the messy genius of the first Manhattanites.<br><br>

The ornament-encrusted building served as the new headquarters of the New York State Chamber of Commerce, a venerable institution founded at Fraunces Tavern in 1768 (before the Revolution had made the Tavern famous).<br><br>Starting in Colonial times, the Chamber commissioned portraits of New York’s preeminent merchants and leaders, from sea captain Preserved Fish, to patriots George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, to the great 19th- and 20th-century titans of finance &#8211; eventually amassing the likenesses of some 200 worthies. The Chamber’s new quarters on Liberty Street were specially designed to accommodate this priceless collection, in a Great Hall measuring 90 feet by 6o feet, ringed in Honduras mahogany, and rising to a decoratively carved ceiling 38 feet overhead. The Chamber and the collection have moved on, but the building has been restored.<br><br><b>Liberty Tower</b><br>The 33-story Liberty Tower is one of the city’s earliest romantic skyscrapers, a Gothic-inspired, terra-cotta tower completed three years before the better known Gothic-inspired, terra-cotta Woolworth Building. Its promoters, typical of the race for fame of Lower Manhattan skyscrapers, claimed for Liberty Tower the title, if not of world’s tallest building, then at least of world’s tallest building on such a small site. Among the many financial district employees who reported to work at 55 Liberty Street was the future 32nd President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who held a job in the Fidelity and Deposit Company’s first floor offices in the 1920s, shortly before becoming Governor of New York State.<br><br>Today Liberty Tower claims the distinction of being among the very first Lower Manhattan skyscrapers converted to residential use, anticipating a major 1990s trend by almost two decades.]]></desc>

Back in the 1950s, while other banks were deserting Downtown for Midtown, Chase Manhattan Bank commissioned this majestic, 60-story, steel-and-glass tower-in-a-plaza. The new skyscraper, rising on a superblock assembled from tiny parcels of land defined by ancient winding Dutch streets, launched a new round of Downtown development. Vice Chairman David Rockefeller, who encouraged the choice of a modern design, oversaw its construction. Chinese investment group Fosun International bought the property in 2013 and renamed it 28 Liberty. Fosun will modernize 28 Liberty and transform it into a true mixed-use property with retail stores at and below grade, an events and restaurant venue on the top floor and an activated plaza with events for office workers and the community.<br><br>
Rising from the plaza is Jean Dubuffet’s sculpture &#8220;Group of Four Trees&#8221; &#8211; 25 tons of fiberglass, aluminum and steel fabricated outside Paris and shipped to New York in 19 pieces. At four stories high, it is among the tallest sculptures in New York. Trees arrived in 1972 as Rockefeller’s gift &#8220;for the enjoyment of the Downtown community,&#8221; marking his 25th anniversary on Wall Street. Dubuffet’s work complements Isamu Noguchi’s sunken sculpture garden &#8211; 60 feet across with basalt rocks imported from Japan’s Uji River.]]></desc>

The simple 1985 granite and glass-block wall, 14 feet high by 70 feet long, is inscribed with writings. Mostly excerpts from letters home by soldiers, some of whom were killed in action, they evoke the emotion of the war. Shelves are provided for flowers, wreaths and candles. At dusk, the memorial is lit from within.<br><br><b>Dutch City Hall Site</b><br>Building Downtown means building on history &#8211; literally. The office building at 85 Broad Street occupies the site of New York’s very first city hall, a 1642 tavern (the Stadt Herbergh) on Pearl Street &#8211; converted for the purpose in 1653 by the good burghers of the original Dutch colony. Renamed the Stadt Huys (City Hall), it stood here until 1697.<br><br>Given the history, and the imminent destruction of any underground remains by the proposed construction of 85 Broad, in 1980 the site was temporarily turned over to a team of archeologists undertaking New York’s first large-scale archaeological dig. Although they found no trace of the Stadt Huys, the excavators did uncover the foundations of another early building &#8211; the Lovelace Tavern, built in 1670 for New York’s second English governor, Sir Francis Lovelace &#8211; and some 10,000 fragments of old Dutch tobacco pipes, 11,000 pieces of glass, and 23,000 shards of ceramic pottery. Remnants of the foundations and photographs of some of these artifacts can be seen in the plaza, under glass &#8211; a window into Downtown’s archaeological past.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Abraham De Peyster Statue<br>
Thomas Paine Park<br><br>
This impressive bronze statue, created by American sculptor George Edwin Bissell (1839-1920), depicts mayor Abraham De Peyster (1657-1728). Born in New Amsterdam (now known as &#8220;Manhattan&#8221;), De Peyster came from a prosperous mercantile family. In his youth he spent nine years working on the family farm in the Netherlands, before returning in 1684 to New Amsterdam. He quickly ascended the city’s political ladder, occupying almost all of the important colonial offices, including alderman, mayor, member of the King’s Council, and acting governor. De Peyster amassed great wealth, and by the end of his life is said to have been one of the city’s wealthiest merchants.<br><br>
In the late 19th century, John Watts De Peyster, Abraham’s great-great-great grandson, commissioned this statue. Bissell, whose family ran a marble company in Poughkeepsie, New York, sculpted the piece in his studio in Mount Vernon, New York, and cast the bronze at the E. Gruet foundry in Paris. He also sculpted the portrait of President Chester A. Arthur (1898) located in Madison Square Park, as well as that of John Watts in Trinity Church Cemetery. He depicted De Peyster, spotting a lavish cloak, army boots, and sword in hand denoting his political and military roles in the colonial government.<br><br>
The De Peyster sculpture was originally placed in the center of nearby Bowling Green Park in 1896 at a site once occupied by a state of King George III. Vandalism of the statue required replication of a bronze tassel in 1912, prompted the resetting of the sword in 1939, and an overall conservation effort in 1942. In 1972, park and subway renovations at Bowling Green forced removal of the statue. It was relocated four years later on a new pink granite pedestal (on which the original inscription was transcribed) in Hanover Square. In 1999, the statue was conserved by Parks’ Citywide Monuments Conservation program, a public-private initiative, which removed advanced corrosion, repatined the bronze surface and applied protective coverings.<br><br>
The World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001 again brought about the displacement of the de (sic) Peyster sculpture, when in 2003 Hanover Square was redesigned and dedicated to the memory of British victims on 9/11. After a prolonged search for a new home in Lower Manhattan, city officials selected a recessed niche in the northern pathway of Thomas Paine Park, as an appropriate location for De Peyster&#8212;resonant in historical associations from early Dutch settlement to later immigrant arrivals. The sculpture was reinstalled there in December 2013, and a bronze marker set in the pavement to identify the subject and artist. On July 3, 2014, the 357th anniversary of de Peyster’s baptism, the sculpture was rededicated in the presence of more than two dozen of de Peyster’s descendants, city officials, and the Netherlands Consul General.]]></desc>

Foley Square c. 1800 consists of a central medallion surrounded by four segments of three medallions.<br><br>
Central medallion: Map of Foley Square c. 1800<br>
Around the perimeter: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain Unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.<br><br>
Segment One<br>
Medallion One: Jan Teunizen &#8211; Windmolen<br>
Dutch colonists continued their tradition of using wind power to grind grains into flour and meal. Surrounded by water, the island of Manhattan provided ideal conditions for windmills.<br>
Medallion Two: Nieuw Amsterdam 1653-1664<br>
Medallion Three: Hendrick Hudson &#8211; Halve Maen<br>
Hired in 1609 by the Dutch East India Company to find a shorter route to China & India, Henry Hudson found a great fur-trading region instead. The Dutch West India Company was created to profit from this discovery.<br><br>
Segment Two: <br>
Medallion One: The Fugio Cent was the first official cent coined by the new United States in 1787. One side shows 13 linked rings representing the original 13 colonies. The other side has Benjamin Franklin’s motto, &#8220;Mind Your Business&#8221;.<br>
Medallion Two: The Powder House 1728-1789<br>
Medallion Three: The town Powder House was located on a tiny spit of land between Collect and Little Collect Ponds, an Ideal storage place for explosives.<br><br>
Segment Three:<br>
Medallion One: Hangings at the Powder House gibbet<br>
An unsolved robbery and unexplained fires caused fears of a slave uprising in 1741. The resulting conspiracy trial put 32 enslaved men and 3 white colonists to death by hanging or burning, and exiled others.
Medallion Two: The Panic of 1741 - The Great New York Conspiracy<br>
Medallion Three: Burning at the stake<br>
The Powder House gibbet was the site of the &#8220;Slave Conspiracy&#8221; executions by hanging. Executions by burning at the stake occurred further east on Magazine Street. Judge D. Horsmanden described the events in his journal.<br><br>
Segment Four:<br>
Medallion One: George III, Pitt & Liberty - Liberty Pole 1766<br>
The first Liberty Pole was erected in 1766 on the Town Common to celebrate the repeal of the Stamp Act. More poles were erected to protest British dominion until the new nation was created in 1776.<br>
Medallion Two: The American Revolutionary War 1775-1783 &#8211; The mustering of troops on The Commons<br>
Medallion Three: Bridewell Prison<br>
Built as a city prison in 1775, the Bridewell was used to imprison American revolutionaries during British occupation of the city. Ethan Allen, a revolutionary leader, was imprisoned in the New Gaol nearby.<br><br>]]></desc>

<i>(Medallion)</i> The leveling of the hills • Fresh water pond filled 1802-1812<br><br>

As early as 1780, draining the Collect Ponds was suggested to rid the area of pestilence thought to originate in this swampy land. The adjacent tanneries and foundries, however, depended on this water for production and waste disposal. By the end of the 1700’s the ponds were so polluted that the Common Council demanded they be filled. The nearby hills were razed to fill the pond, creating level terrain.<br><br>

<i>(Medallion)</i> Five Points / New immigrants & exploitation<br><br>

In the 1840’s, European and Irish immigrants and free blacks lived in the notorious Five Points district, where five streets crossed. This was an area of extreme poverty, crime, and disease. Wealthier immigrants lived in the blocks west of Centre Street. Class and racial conflict led to the 1863 Draft Riots, when poor immigrants resisted the Civil War draft. Part of Five Points was cleared to create the Civic Center in the 1920’s.<br><br>

<i>(Medallion)</i> The McCullough Shot Tower • James Bogardus<br><br>

The manufacture of lead shot consisted of dropping molten lead through a sieve at the top of a tower into a tank of water at its base. As it fell, a sphere was formed. In 1855, James Bogardus built a 175-foot tall octagonal shot tower near this point. The foundation may remain buried here. The first of its kind with a free-standing, cast iron frame and brick curtain wall, this structure was the forerunner of today’s skyscraper.<br><br>

Designed by Henry Ives Cobb and built in 1909, this handsome Neo-Gothic skyscraper is an important predecessor of the Woolworth Building. One of the earliest of the Romantic skyscrapers that changed the skyline of Manhattan at the beginning of the 20th Century, Liberty Tower was the headquarters of the Sinclair Oil Company from 1909 to 1945. Rising 33 stories without a setback, the façade is clad entirely in white terra cotta and enlivened with fanciful ornament, including birds and alligators. Once known as &#8220;the tallest building in the world on so small an area of ground&#8221;, this freestanding building was the site of one of the earliest residential conversion projects in Lower Manhattan.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This park in the heart of New York City’s civic center is named for patriot, author, humanitarian, and political visionary Thomas Paine (1737-1809). The land that is now Thomas Paine Park was once part of a freshwater swamp surrounded, ironically, by three former British prisons for revolutionaries. One of them was The Bridewell, the infamous detention center where many inmates died from wind and cold exposure while awaiting sentencing. After the war, the area went through more hard times. In the 19th century it was one of the most notorious slums in the country: Five Points, a community of predominantly Irish immigrants. After calls for reform, the City acquired and condemned most of the unsafe buildings between 1887 and 1894.<br><br>
The City acquired this site, located between Lafayette, Worth, and Centre Streets within what is now called Foley Square, on August 5, 1913 and transferred title to Parks on March 19, 1930. Before this acquisition, it was known simply as &#8220;Courthouse Plot&#8221; because of its proximity to several State and Federal court buildings.<br><br>
In 1977, through the initiative of City Council President Paul O’Dwyer, the Council renamed the parcel at New York’s center of law and justice Thomas Paine Park. In 2000 several adjacent streets were eliminated to unite the parcels that make up Foley Square. Following this renovation, Thomas Paine Park was officially integrated into Foley Square and rededicated.<br><br>
In 2013, George Edwin Bissell’s sculpture of Abraham de Peyster (1657-1728), former New York City mayor (1691-1694), was reinstalled in the park. The relocation of this sculpture, which was originally cast in 1896, to this downtown park is particularly apt given its historical associations to early Dutch settlement and later immigrant arrivals. On July 8, 2014, the 357th anniversary of de Peyster’s baptism, the sculpture was rededicated in the presence of more than two dozen de Peyster descendants, city officials, and the Netherlands Consul General.<br><br>
The park’s namesake, Thomas Paine, was an Englishman from Thetford in County Norfolk. He spent his early years committed to justice in Britain, speaking out for social equity and lobbying for higher wares. In 1774, at the urging of Benjamin Franklin, then colonial ambassador to Britain, Paine immigrated to Philadelphia. He became a close associate of Franklin, the other founding fathers, and the Marquis de Lafayette. His writings profoundly influenced the course of the American Revolution and the creation of the United States government.<br><br>
Paine published the unsigned pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i> on January 10, 1776. It advocated rising up in arms against Britain, and many of its ideas are echoed in the Declaration of Independence. His description of a representative government became the basis for modern democracy anchored by a written constitution. Paine’s sixteen <i>American Crisis</i> essays boosted morale during the darkest days of the Revolutionary War. For his service to the fledgling nation, New York State later gave Paine a 277-acre farm in New Rochelle, new York.<br><br>
His most famous work, <i>Rights of Man</i> (1791), was written after the French Revolution and proposes that government is responsible for protecting the natural rights of its people. Many of Paine’s ideas were strikingly far sighted. He advocated for the abolition of slavery, defended freedom of thought and expression, and proposed an association of nations to avert the spread of conflicts.<br><br>
In 1802, Paine returned to America, where he was the guest of President Jefferson, to whom he recommended the Louisiana Purchase. Paine tried to settle down on his farm, but his declining health led him to move to Manhattan in 1804. He died in Greenwich Village on June 8, 1809. His remains were buried on his New Rochelle farm. It was not until several years after his death that dedicated friends and biographers began to remind the public of Paine’s contributions to American freedom and democracy.<br><br>

<i>Terrarium</i> by Grimanesa Amaros is a permanent, site-specific, public art project located at 54 N. Moore Street in Tribeca, New York City. The function of this 110 year-old building has changed over time from a storage site to a grocery, from a dye firm to a drug company. Today it houses residential and commercial lofts. I want to create a piece that reflects the evolution of Tribecca &#8211; a neighborhood constantly in flux.<br><br>
The term &#8220;terrarium&#8221; refers to a glass enclosure used for sustaining plant and animal life in an unusual atmosphere &#8211; most often indoors. Although intending to reproduce a natural environment, these terrariums are a far cry from the fields and forests of the countryside. Instead, they are isolated, veritably existing in an artificial world of in-betweens.<be><br>
<i>Terrarium</i> is an installation intended to provide lighting to the lobby of a landmark building. From dusk to dawn, shifting patterns of light radiate from an assortment of acrylic bubbles mounted on the walls. The work is an organic space within the city and a simultaneous extension of the urban surroundings. The spherical shapes and colors evoke an almost amphibian quality, yet displayed within these bubbles are photographs showing us the past and present life of this building. The place represents the middle ground between the private and public, a compromise between the tranquility of the indoors and the din of the hectic city.<br><br>
This work of art is meant to inspire reflection. The contradictions embodied therein evoke a feeling of elements taken out of context, rearranged, and reconstructed to form something entirely new. To passers-by on the street, it is an alteration of a familiar landscape, a moment to re-imagine their daily world.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Franklin Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Finn Square<br>
.1 acre<br><br>
In 1919, the widening and extension of Varick Street created a triangular space at Varick’s intersection with West Broadway and Franklin Street. The Board of Aldermen (predecessor of the City Council) named the space for Philip Schuyler Finn, who lost his life in 1918 fighting World War I with New York’s 69th Regiment, the famous &#8220;Fighting Irish.&#8221; Nevertheless, for most inhabitants of Lower Manhattan in the early 1900s, Finn Square conjured up memories of Philip Schuyler’s father, Daniel E. Finn (1845-1910).<br><br>
&#8220;Battery Dan&#8221; as the older Finn was known, was a Tammany Hall Politician and Democratic leader of Lower Manhattan. He won his nickname and the hearts of his constituents when he successfully opposed the construction of commercial piers along Battery Park, citing the necessity for open space in the crowded neighborhood. He became a city magistrate and police judge in 1904, dispensing advice rather than harsh sentence. Admonitions like &#8220;Don’t try to compel a girl to love you if she loves someone else. Get another to take her place,&#8221; to two youths fighting over a girl, or &#8220;Don’t wreck or sell your body and soul for diamonds and automobiles,&#8221; to a prostitute endeared him to New Yorkers across the city. No incident caused more amusement than Finn’s encounter with three bulldogs on his way to a court session in the Bronx. Under attack, he climbed a lamppost and yelled for help. Local papers carried the story and New York loved it.<br><br>
A New York Times editorial at the time of his death in 1910 praised him as &#8220;an idealist,&#8221; &#8220;a friend of the people,&#8221; and added, &#8220;He was fairly adored by thousands as leader, friend, a protector.&#8221; Crowds of mourners lined the streets as Finn’s funeral procession ked to St. Peter’s Church.<br><br>
Today the working class Irish neighborhood in what was Manhattan’s West Ward has become the fashionable Tribeca (TRiangle BElow CAnal Street), and Finn Square reflects the change. For almost 70 years, it was a weed-cover slab of concrete. Today it contains a triangle shaped garden bordered by cobblestones that is a profusion of flowers and shrubs. Thornless honey locust trees (Gleditsia triacanthos inermis) and flowering dogwoods (Cornus florida) provide a green canopy, and grassy plots separate the flowerbeds.<br><br>
The transformation, which took place in April 1998, is the product of Greenstreets, a joint program started in 1986 and revived in 1994 by Parks and the Department of Transportation, to turn drab traffic islands into attractive green spaces with the help of community volunteers. Parks planted the trees, and Tribeca residents planted the flowers and maintain the garden<br><br>

St. Paul’s Chapel has withstood adversity throughout its many years. On September 21, 1776, ten years after the Chapel opened, a raging fire swept through Lower Manhattan, destroying a quarter of the city, including Trinity Church (St. Paul’s parish home). The community saved St. Paul’s by forming a bucket brigade and dousing the Chapel with water. With Trinity in ruins, St. Paul’s became the primary church until 1790.<br>
225 years later, another tragedy struck on September 11, 2001. The collapse of the World Trade Center buildings across the street from St. Paul’s left Lower Manhattan and St. Paul’s churchyard littered with debris. Miraculously there was no physical damage to the Chapel itself. For nine months after the attacks, St. Paul’s offered Ground Zero recovery workers a place to rest, eat, and receive medical care. On November 3, 2003, more than two years later, the churchyard reopened to the public.<br>]]></desc>

The St. Regis Hotel, one of the most elegant and sophisticated Beaux-Arts style buildings in New York, in among the oldest of the early &#8220;skyscraper&#8221; hotels. Commissioned by John Jacob Astor, it heralded the transformation of Fifth Avenue from a street of mansions, private clubs and churches to a thoroughfare of hotels, skyscrapers and fashionable shops. The turn-of-the-century, Gilded Age hostelry was doubled in size by a 1920s addition that transformed it into a major hotel for the newly emerging modern metropolis. The vast 1991 renovation replaced the building’s mechanical systems and restored its Edwardian magnificence.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Manhattan’s only pre-Revolutionary church building has a remarkable history stretching from George Washington’s inauguration to the attack of September 11th. Built in the 1760s, on what was then the outskirts of town, St. Paul’s originally served residents of the hinterland as a chapel of Wall Street’s Trinity Church. Designed in the English Georgian style (named for King George the First, Second and Third), St. Paul’s was one of dozens of churches throughout the British Empire modeled after St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London’s Trafalgar Square.<br><br>The columned entrance porch on Broadway leads, surprisingly, directly into the altar-end of the church instead of the rear of the sanctuary &#8211; the main entrance is through the Colonial-era churchyard to the west. The white, wooden interior has changed little from George Washington’s days. The President was a regular during his first years in office, when New York was the nation’s capital, and his pew survives, carefully preserved and roped off on the side.<br><br>St. Paul’s developed a reputation as Downtown’s most peaceful oasis &#8211; a role suddenly transformed by the collapse of the World Trade Center, directly across Church Street. Within a month of the disaster, St. Paul’s had organized a massive relief effort. From October 2001 through June 2002, volunteers from all over the country provided recovery workers with food, cots and teddy bears, while chaplains offered comfort and moral support. Thousands of visitors to the Chapel turned its wrought-iron fence into an impromptu memorial covered with posters, flags, letters and more.<br><br>Despite St. Paul’s unexpected role in the wake of the tragedy, life at the Chapel goes on. Besides holding regular religious services, St. Paul’s continues to operate a transition shelter for homeless men run by Trinity Church volunteers, and to host weekly noonday concerts open to the public, a tradition since 1968.]]></desc>

This elegant French Renaissance style stable was constructed in 1902-03, reminiscent of the early 17th century town houses that line the Places des Vosges in Paris. An early work by noted architects York & Sawyer, it was commissioned by philanthropist Helen Miller Gould, the eldest daughter of financier Jay Gould. Faced with red brick and limestone, the four-story structure features as arched entrance and a steep slate mansard roof flanked by tall chimneys. Built to keep horses and vehicles and to store feed, the structure originally contained apartments for the coachman and groom on the upper floors. The building was converted to commercial use in 1957.<br><br>

Prominent Banker Philip Lehman, a son of the founder of the Lehman Brothers banking firm, commissioned this elegant Beaux-Arts town house in 1899-1900 at a time when this area of Manhattan was transforming into a fashionable neighborhood. Architect J H. Duncan, who also created the General Grant National Memorial and the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Arch in Brooklyn, designed a rusticated limestone façade with luxuriant relief carving surmounted by an elaborately designed two-story mansard roof. When many mansions were converted to commercial and apartment use after World War I, the Lehman residence remained in the family. With its exuberant design, this town house is a distinguished reminder of the fine residences that lined the blocks west of Fifth Avenue at the turn of the century.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[The Crystal Palace]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near West 42nd Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[By the early 1850s New York had grown to sufficient size and prominence that the city decided to host a major exhibition similar to London’s Great Exhibition of 1851. The Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations &#8211; a world’s fair precursor &#8211; opened July 14, 1853 in a still sparsely developed part of the city. Fortieth and Forty-second Streets bounded the four-acre site immediately west of the Croton Distributing Reservoir, today’s Bryant Park.<br><br>
To house the exhibition, Georg Carstensen, and Charles Gildemeister designed a remarkable iron-and-glass structure, much like an enormous greenhouse. The building was inspired by the one built in London for its exhibition two years earlier, also called the Crystal Palace.<br><br>
The Crystal Palace was one of the largest and most sophisticated designs that had ever been built in America. Octagonal in plan, it was surmounted by a soaring 123-foot-high dome, and inspired American architects and builders with the possibilities of iron construction. The exhibition hall comprised fifteen thousand panels of glass.<br><br>
Four thousand exhibitors filled the hall with the industrial wares, consumer goods, and art works of the nation. Elisha Graves Otis, a young inventor and entrepreneur, staged one of the most dramatic of the exhibits. Otis had been promoting his steam-powered elevators, but what, people wondered, would happen should the cable break? To allay such fears, he invented the automatic safety brake &#8211; but he had to demonstrate the invention.<br><br>
Otis erected a high platform connected to one of his elevators. He himself got in the cab, and cut the cable. As the cab fell, his new spring-leaf safety brake was successfully activated.<br><br>
A prominent New York merchant of china and glassware, who may have witnessed Otis’s demonstration at the fair, ordered and installed the invention in his new store at Broadway and Broome Street. The safety elevator in the Haughwout Building, completed in 1857 (and still standing), was the first in the world to be installed in a commercial building.<br><br>
The exhibition set off one of the first major tourism booms in New York, and many hotels were built. One visitor was seventeen-year-old Samuel Langhorne Clemens of Hannibal, Missouri. Later, as Mark Twain, he wrote that the Crystal Place was &#8220;beautiful beyond description,&#8221; and marveled that the six thousand daily visitors to the exhibition were double the population of his hometown. Over one million people visited the Crystal Palace Exhibition before it closed on November 1, 1854. Despite its popularity, exhibition sponsors lost $300,000.<br><br>
After the fair, the structure, believed to be fireproof, was leased for a variety of purposes. On October 5, 1858, in a spectacular blaze it burned to the ground. Remarkably, no lives were lost.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Within hours of the cowardly attacks of September 11, 2001, America’s Special Operations Forces were called to action, formulating an unconventional warfare response to the acts of terror inflicted on our country. Not since the patriots’ actions of Concord and Lexington in our Revolution has first priority been given to such an unconventional approach. The force’s choice, eventually known as Task Force Dagger, was a multiservice, inter-agency task force built primarily around the Green Berets of the 5th Special Forces Group. Key to the Task Force’s success was a partnership formed between Army Special Operations, The Central Intelligence Agency, Air Force Special Operations and other inter-agency elements. Task Force Dagger was an unprecedented combination of our nation’s finest uniformed and civilian professionals brought together to accomplish their designed mission: destroy the Taliban regime and deny Afghanistan as a sanctuary for Al Qaeda. On the night of October 19, 2001, braving severe weather conditions and a ruthless enemy, the &#8220;A&#8221; teams of the 5th Special Forces Group began infiltrating throughout Afghanistan. Helicopter infiltration and fire support was provided by the world’s finest helicopter aviators, the &#8220;Nightstalkers&#8221; of the Army’s 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment. Operating together with their CIA counterparts and Air Force Combat Controllers, the teams made contact with the various ethnic indigenous resistance forces still holding out against the Taliban regime. Collectively, these integrated &#8220;A&#8221; Teams fought heroically under incredible dangerous and austere conditions alongside their Afghan counterparts and accomplished what so many said could not be done. Overthrowing the Taliban in that most dangerous of countries, Afghanistan, America’s Response Monument, &#8220;De Oppresso Liber&#8221;, features a Special Forces soldier representative of the many operational detachments &#8220;A&#8221; who operated across Afghanistan. Some of these A-Teams uniquely fought mounted on horseback alongside their Uzbek counterparts, successfully blending both ancient and 21st Century state of the art methods of warfare against our enemies. These operators, informally referred to as &#8220;Horse Soldiers&#8221; or &#8220;Afghan Mounted Rifles,&#8221; were the first Americans to fight on horseback in over 50 years. This image was selected because it typifies the courage, adaptability and resourcefulness that are hallmarks of America’s Special Operations community. The steel girder protruding from beneath the rocks is an actual piece of the World Trade Center towers and as such is considered a national treasure. It symbolizes the connection between the events of 9/11 and the actions of the Special Operations heroes this monument honors. You are welcome and encouraged to touch it. This monument is intended to honor the incredible courage, initiative and resourcefulness of all members of all branches of the Armed Forces who went and fought in the Battle of 9/11. It recognizes all the men of the Special Forces, all the great men and women of our joint Special Operations Forces, the intrepid officers of the central Intelligence Agency and the entire inter-agency teams whose dedication, courage and commitment to the people of the United States of America were called upon in those terrible early days following the attacks of 9/11 to bring justice to those who would attack us. This monument serves as a most grateful recognition by the American people of their extraordinary service and sacrifice.<br>

The Upper East Side, today one of the world’s most elegant residential and shopping districts, was first built up following the creation of nearby Central Park between 1857 and 1877. It has gone through several development phases, each of them distinctive and still represented today. Middle-class brownstones in the Italianate and Neo-Grec mode of the 1860’s to the 1880’s exist on the side streets. The Beaux-Arts palaces and Neo-French chateaux of the period, designed by McKim, Mead & White and other architects for the Whitneys, Astors, Loebs, and Whitneys, recall the days when those names were synonymous with America’s industrial and economic power. The Neo-Classical Revival facades from the early 20th Century show a change in taste from 19th Century eclectic opulence; and the luxury apartment houses of the 1910-1930 period sought to retain the high style of private residences, while accommodating a basic change in lifestyle.<br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
The African Burial Ground was active until 1794. Within an area of not quite six acres, perhaps as many as 20,000 people were interred, mostly free or enslaved Africans. During the 18th century, one in ten residents of New York was of African descent, and slavery was widespread in or near the city. The institution of slavery officially endured in New York until July 4, 1827 &#8211; a fact celebrated the next day, July 5, by a parade through the city by hundreds of African-Americans. However, enslaved persons were in fact held in New York beyond that date.<br><br>
Though old city maps show an African Burial Ground near Broadway and Chambers Street, it was not until 1991 that anyone realized thousands of burial sites still existed twenty feet below ground level. Further investigation confirmed that this was one of New York City’s major Colonial-era sites: an African burial ground dating back to the 18th and possibly even the 17th century, one of the very few surviving anywhere in the Americas, and now the largest known excavated African cemetery in the world. The burials were discovered by archeologists digging in advance of a new Federal office building. When bulldozers moved in, angry protests and congressional hearings lead to an Act of Congress that stopped the destruction. Now designated officially as a city, state and national landmark, the African Burial Ground testifies to the centuries-old history of African-American New York. The ancestral remains of 410 African men, women and children were ceremonially reinterred on October 4, 2003.]]></desc>

Africans were brought to the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam from different regions with diverse cultures, religions, and languages. In 1664 the British captured New Amsterdam and renamed it New York. Before the American Revolution, New York had more enslaved Africans &#8211; its most valuable commodity &#8211; than any other colony in the North. There were also free Africans, some descended from those freed by the Dutch West India Company. Men cleared farmland, felled swamps, and built structures and roads like Broadway and The Wall (today’s Wall Street). Women sewed, cooked, harvested, and cared for owners’ children as well as their own. From an early age, children carried water and firewood. The work was hard and death rates for Africans were disproportionately high.]]></desc>

The rediscovery of the burial ground revealed that Africans and their descendants buried loved ones with dignity and respect in the 17th and 18th centuries. More than 90 percent of the 419 human skeletal remains were rapped in shrouds (cloths) and most of the bodies were buried in the full-sized coffins. Africans continued other traditional practices such as placing pennies over the eyes to keep them closed. Small artifacts like beads, cowry shells and cuff links sometimes accompanied the burials.<br><br>
Community activists, politicians, and many others fought vehemently to preserve the burial ground and to honor this history and culture. Their efforts led to the designation of the 0.34 acre of the African Burial Ground as a national monument.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[A Place of Remembrance-(left side of the marker) From the 1690s until 1794, an estimated 15,000 enslaved and free Africans were laid to rest in the African Burial Ground. In 1991, during construction of the Ted Weiss Federal Building, 419 human skeletal remains were exhumed. The rediscovery of the cemetery sparked vigorous efforts to preserve this hallowed ground. In 1993 a small portion of the original 6.6-acre cemetery became the first below-ground New York City landmark and a national historic landmark. African Burial Ground National Monument was proclaimed on February 27, 2006. Widely regarded as one of America’s most significant archeological finds of the 20th century, it is also a place of remembrance and reflection.<p>
Circle of the Diaspora-The African Diaspora is the forced removal of Africans from their homeland to different parts of the world. It is also Africans’ unwavering spirit and ability to adapt. This circular wall, ramp, and interior court display cultural and spiritual images from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and other areas throughout the Diaspora.<p>
Ancestral Chamber (right side of the marker)-The 24-foot-high Ancestral Chamber represents the soaring African spirit and the distance below the ground from which the ancestral remains were exhumed. It is made of Verde Fontaine green granite from Africa. The heart like Sankofa symbol from West Africa means &#8220;to learn from the past to prepare for the future.&#8221; The exterior recalls a ship’s hold and provides a place for individual contemplation and prayer.<p>
Ancestral Reinterment Ground-On October 4, 2003, the exhumed ancestral remains were reburied on this site. The bones and accompanying artifacts were placed in hand-carved wooden coffins made in Ghana and lined with Kente cloth. The coffins were placed in seven crypts as close as possible to the original burial positions with heads facing west. Seven burial mounds mark the locations of the reinterments. If you wish, you may place flowers on top of the burial mounds.]]></desc>

The African Burial Ground was labeled &#8220;Negros Buriel Ground&#8221; on the 1755 map at the right. Colonial New York laws banned African funerals in officially consecrated graveyards, prohibited gatherings of large numbers of enslaved Africans, and decreed that funeral had to be held during daylight. Nonetheless, Africans and their descendants held burial ceremonies in a cemetery outside the city wall, near a ravine. As New York City expanded northeast, the burial ground was closed in 1794 and eventually divided into lots for sale. The land was filled in and buildings were constructed on top. For almost two centuries, New York City’s growth obscured the graves, and the African Burial Ground was nearly forgotten.<br>]]></desc>

Triumph of the Human Spirit<br>
1992-2000<br><br>
This sculpture is dedicated to all the unknown and unnamed Africans brought to this country including the 427 Africans excavated near this site which is now the rediscovered New York City African Burial Ground.<br>
My inspiration for the concept of this sculpture comes from the Bamana people of Mali, West Africa. The vertical portion of the sculpture represents the male and female antelopes from the Chi Wara headdresses. The Chi Wara rests on a horizontal plane which symbolizes the canoes used by Native Americans, the slaving vessels that transported African men, women and children and the passenger ships that brought immigrants to this country. The part of the granite on which these words are inscribed represents the land.<br>
Triumph of the Human Spirit soars high above this plaza as a memorial to our ancestors and to the legacy of our endurance against the odds. It is also a tribute to the memory of my mother, Mary Clark Pace, 1916-91. The original lock shown below was worn by my great-great grandfather, Steve Pace, during his enslavement. The key symbolizes his freedom. The lock and key were passed on to me by my uncle, Julius Pace, in 1991.<br>
Lorenzo Pace<br><br>
Side panel<br>
Chi Wara<br>
The headdresses depicted above are from the Bamana people of Mali, West Africa. These headdresses, known as &#8220;Chi Wara,&#8221; represent mythical male and female &#8220;antelopes&#8221; that the Bamana believe taught people to farm, thus to survive.<br>
The female antelope is distinguished from the male by the young fawn carried on her back. Symbolically, the male represents the sun, the female represents the earth, and the fawn represents humankind. In dance performances, pairs of male and female Chi Wara taught, praised and encourage good farming. In addition, the antelopes dancing together symbolize cooperation between men and women to produce a successful harvest.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[9/11 Cross<br>
A Symbol of Hope<br><br>
Out of the rubble of New York City’s Twin Towers on that fateful 9/11 morning emerged a symbol of hope: a perfectly proportioned cross formed from the steel girders of the previously standing twin towers.<br><br>
The original 9/11 cross was found in the wreckage of the twin towers and subsequently mounted here on this site October 15, 2006, where it stayed until it was moved July 23, 2011 to the September 11 Memorial and Museum at the former World Trade Center site across the street. A hollow spot in the cross holds the remains of the original Twin Tower wreckage.<br><br>
Th artist, selected by Cardinal Egan to craft this new cross was Sculptor Jon Krawczyk who was raised in New Jersey.<br><br>
The cross was built hollow, and on its way to New York from California, John Krawczyk encouraged people to put notes and symbols of loss inside.<br><br>
The hole was sealed up with a piece of the fallen World Trade Center. When it rains, rust from the piece of metal will drip down the rest of the cross, simulating a bleeding Heart. The base of the cross includes a metal book with 35 pages listing the names of all the 9/11 Twin Tower victims. The names were etched in such a way that rubbings can be taken by visitors. The inscription on this memorial book of names is:<br><br>
The cross is a symbol of hope. It speaks of life’s journey and to life’s limitless potential.<br>
For the innocent, whose lives were taken from them, this cross stands as a memorial.<br>
For the courageous, who faced death so others might live, this cross stands as a tribute.<br>
For all of us walking the streets today, the cross reflects who we are and who we may choose to become.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><i>&#8220;I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.&#8221;</i><br><br>This graceful, 13-foot standing bronze figure, sculpted by Frederick MacMonnies (1863-1937), directly faces City Hall and honors the last moments of the 21-year-old American Revolution era spy, Nathan Hale (1755-1776).<br><br>Disguised as a Dutch schoolteacher, Hale attempted to infiltrate New York’s British ranks to gather intelligence on the enemy’s Long Island military installations. The young man was captured, however, on the night of September 21, 1776 and hanged for treason the next morning on a gallows believed to have been erected near 63rd Street and First Avenue.<br><br>Since no life portraits of the patriot spy exist, Frederick Macmonnies’s work offers a romantic interpretation of Hale. The bronze statue of the shackled and bound Hale is set upon a granite base and illustrates the hero’s last predawn moments. Though only 26 when he won the Nathan Hale Memorial Competition, Macmonnies’s sculpture brought him great renown in New York City and also won him a medal from the prestigious Paris Salon.<br><br>MacMonnies is well represented in New York’s parks, with more than a dozen pieces throughout the city, including Horse Tamers (1899) in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, the Army and Navy groups (1901 and 1902) and Quadriga (1901) on the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Arch in Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza, and Civic Virtue (1922), located beside Queens Borough Hall at the corner of Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike.<br><br>Nathan Hale was dedicated by the Sons of the Revolution of New York State on the anniversary of Evacuation Day (commemorating the departure of the last British soldier from the colonies in 1783), November 25, 1893. A gathering is held annually by the Sons of the Revolution on September 22nd at this site, commemorating the anniversary of Hale’s death. The sculpture has been moved several times. In 1999 the statue was moved from Broadway at Murray Street to its current location on the lawn facing City Hall’s entrance plaza and was conserved as part of the park’s general renovation.]]></desc>

Considered one of the great engineering achievements of the mid-19th century, the aqueduct transported water from a reservoir located more than 40 miles north of lower Manhattan. The fountain was dedicated at a ceremony celebrating the completion of the aqueduct. The Croton Fountain’s circular stone basin was 100 feet in diameter, and the fountain could project a spire of water more than 50 feet into the air.]]></desc>

Constructed from 1803 to 1812, New York’s City Hall is one of the oldest continuously used City Halls in the nation, and houses the offices of the Mayor and City Council, the executive and legislative branches of the government. Considered one of the finest architectural achievements of the period, City Hall was designed by architects Joseph Francois Mangin (fl. 1794-1818), a French émigré, and John McComb, Jr. (1763-183), a native New Yorker. The building is in the Federal style, with clear French influences that can be seen in the large arched windows, delicate ornamental swags, and more decorative Corinthian- and Ionic-style columns and pilasters. City Hall is a designated New York City landmark, and its soaring rotunda, dramatically encircled by a keystone-cantilevered staircase, is a designated interior landmark.<br><br>
In 2010, the City launched the City Hall Rehabilitation to correct structural issues and preserve the historic building. In addition to structural repairs, the project included the installation of a new fire safety system, an energy-efficient heating and cooling system, a fuel cell, and vastly improved electrical service in order to bring the building up to 21st century standards.<br><br>

<i>Manhattan Sentinels,</i>1996<br><br>
The sculpture group <i>Manhattan Sentinels</i> includes four cast-iron totemic forms that range in size from 36 to 39 feet and incorporate grass and seating areas on two plazas flanking the Federal Office Building at 26 Federal Plaza. These sculptures stand in active dialogue with our urban spaces. In the past, forms such as these served as monuments to civic pride or spiritual devotion. Today they also celebrate human aspirations and continuity, and invite us to reflect on shared meanings and experiences.<br><br>
Beverly Pepper was born in New York City where she studied at Pratt Institute and the Art Students League. She was trained with Fernand Leger and at the Grande Chaumiere with Andre Lhote in Paris, France. Her works are represented in major museums and public and private collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Florence Museum of Art, Italy; and the Barcelona Museum of Modern Art, Spain.<br><br>]]></desc>

This medallion lies just beyond the edge of the African Burial Ground. Closed in 1794, the African Burial ground once covered more than 5 acres &#8211; about 5 city blocks. It is estimated that about 10,000 men, women and children of African Heritage were buried in the original cemetery. Nestled between hills, a portion of the graveyard was covered with earth and buildings as the city expanded northward. It was assumed destroyed by centuries of development; however, in the early 1900’s intact burials were unearthed during the construction of 290 Broadway. The site is now a National Historic Landmark and within the New York City African Burial Ground and Commons Historic District. The surviving remnant of the burial ground is dedicated to all who were enslaved in the city’s early history from 1825 until July 4, 1827, Emancipation Day in New York.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
When native people of the Delaware nation speak of the place known today as Manhattan, they say <b>Hay-La-Py-Ee-Chen Quay-Hee-OLass</b>. This means &#8220;the place where the sun is born.&#8221; They also call it <b>Menatay</b>, &#8220;the island&#8221;. Their stories speak of it as a gathering place for native people. Goods from far away, such as the bright copper of the Great lakes and the sparkling mica of the Carolina highlands were traded for shining bead shells, stone tools and <b>Hans-Queem</b> (Golden Maize).<br><br>
Although the island has always been too rocky to support much agriculture, farming communities thrived around Menatay where the soil was well drained and the water was good. Following the round of the seasons, the first people planted, hunted and fished in the spring. In the warmest season, when the smell of wildflowers perfumed the air, they traveled for trade and adventure, meeting here to exchange goods, share knowledge, give thanks, and show respect to the spirits. When the leaves changed color, the villagers gathered to harvest, hunt and collect food for the winter. During the cold moons of long nights, they made objects for trade, repaired tools, told lesson stories, and celebrated festivals.<br><br>
Menatay, where waterways of river and ocean link the directions, has always been a place where goods and ideas can be shared.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Lower Manhattan Today
The ever-growing Manhattan community is a dynamic mixture of businesses, residences, and cultural institutions of interest to visitors and residents alike.<br>
Destinations marked in a red dot indicate those points of interest which have contemporary and historical relevance to Native American cultures.<br><br>
1) Governors Island US Coast Guard Base<br>
In the early 17th century, the island was a place of extensive trade between Native Americans and Dutch colonists for the much-coveted fur trade of the region.<br>
2) Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty<br>
A sacred site to the Delaware people, this island became a central entry point for US immigrants from 1892-1954.<br>
3) Castle Clinton National Memorial, Battery Park<br>
In 1833, shortly after surrendering to the US, Sauk-Fox leader Black Hawk visited this former military outpost.<br>
5) Alexander Hamilton US Customs House and Bowling Green Park, 1 Bowling Green<br>
The National Museum of the US Indian in the US Customs House now occupies the original site of the Dutch-built Fort Amsterdam. One of the most popular myths about Manhattan is Peter Minuit’s &#8220;purchase&#8221; of the island from local native peoples. The place now known as Bowling Green Park.<br>
7) Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 54 Pearl Street<br>
This memorial pays tribute to the men and women who served in the Vietnam War, among them over 41,500 Native Americans.<br>
10) Wall Street<br>
In 1653, Dutch colonists built a great wooden wall to keep out the &#8220;northern Indians&#8221;. When the barrier was dismantled, the path left behind became known as Wall Street.<br>
14) World Trade Center<br>
The &#8220;twin towers&#8221;, tallest buildings in New York, were constructed with the help of native American steelworkers.<br>
16) Brooklyn Bridge<br>
Towering above a canoe route once used by native people, the Brooklyn Bridge spans the shortest distance between Manhattan and Brooklyn.<br>
27) American Indian Community House, 404 Lafayette Street<br>
American Indian Community House Gallery, 708 Broadway, 2nd floor<br>
Founded in 1978, American Indian Community House is the only American Indian-owned and operated-gallery in the greater New York area. The gallery exhibits contemporary fine art in all media by native Americans nationwide.<br><br>

&#8220;It appears that the museum is on the road to fulfilling its potential and viable resource for education, training, and employment for the Native American community and most importantly as a vehicle for reinforcing out sense of pride as who were are as people.&#8221;<br>

As the years pass and native people again find traveling easier, many descendants of the first Menatay inhabitants are returning to their native land. Here they meet native people from many nations. Once, Native Americans, viewed as exotic people, were brought here to take part in Wild West shows. We now see diplomatic visits by such contemporary natives as Rigoberto Menchu, the Mayan who won the Nobel Peace Prize, gatherings as American Indian Community House, and ceremonies like the one led by Chief Richard Snake, a Moraviantown Delaware, to give Inwood Hill Park back its original name Shorakapok (edge of the river).<br><br>
Red Cloud, the Lakota chief, was one of those who visited New York to speak for his people. On June 16, 1870, he spoke at the Great Hall of Cooper Union to an audience divided between those wanting to see a &#8220;real wild Indian&#8221; and those believing justice and understanding would solve the problems between white and Indian.<br><br>
In a similar vein, October 22, 1991, Thomas Banyaca, a Hopi spiritual elder, made his fourth pilgrimage to bring his people’s message of peace to the United Nations &#8211; foretold in the ancient Hopi prophecies as &#8220;the great house of mica on the eastern shore where nations come together to solve the world’s problems without war.&#8221;]]></desc>

Completed in 1907, the US Customs House was built when the United States was becoming an economic world power &#8211; and the Port of New York one of the most prosperous trade centers. Duties extracted by the United States Customs Service yielded the greatest single source of revenue for the government before the imposition of the income tax in 1916. Speaking hundreds of languages, merchants came here daily, exchanging millions of dollars worth of currency. Just as Manhattan had once been a place of trade and cultural exchange for native Americans, it now became a rendezvous for people from all over the world.<br><br>
The architecture of the US Customs House was planned to reflect the role of commerce in American life, an America in which Indians had little place. In 1899 the United States Department of the Treasury sponsored a design competition for the building. Cass Gilbert won for his Beaux-Arts design depicting a grand monument to trade. On top of each exterior column rests the head of Mercury, Roman god of commerce. Statues on the sixth-story cornice represent the world’s most successful commercial city-states in history. In Daniel Chester French’s sculpture of North American (on the left side of the staircase), the Native American is symbolically left behind, peering over the shoulder of &#8220;America,&#8221; who sits with ears of corn in her lap.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[A Place of Many Names<br><br>
New York City has been known by many names among native people. It was Kanonoge, &#8220;place of reeds,&#8221; to Mohawk people living up the Hudson River. It was Menatay (island) to the Delaware people. Algonquin-speaking Munsee people knew the island as Manatuouh, &#8220;place for gathering firewood,&#8221; and Manahachtanienk, &#8220;place of general inebriation.&#8221; These are typical of native placenames, which usually reflect environmental or social conditions &#8211; in the last case, a half-humorous, half-bitter awareness of the problems of alcohol.<br><br>
Other Algonquin-speaking people sharing similar customs, cultures and beliefs journeyed to Manhattan. Mohegans and Pequots from eastern Connecticut, native Long Islanders like the Montauks and Shinnecocks, and other people living east to the sunrise navigated dugout canoes tow (sic) the place now called New York Harbor. Manicans journeyed down the river while Unami and other southern Delaware people paddled north. Algonquin dialects were similar enough for communication, but different enough to preserve tribal uniqueness.<br><br>
Although languages such as Mohawk, spoken by the nearby Iroquois, differ from Algonquin tongues as much as English differs from Chinese, intertwining circles of trade, kinship and politics connect all the region’s people like beads on a sinew string. Today, many Indian names remain in the New York City area, such as Rockaway (sandy place) and Nyack (point of land). These place names remind native people of ancestors who together smelled the salt air of the same ocean.]]></desc>

The US Custom House stands on the same ground as Fort Amsterdam, which was occupied by the Dutch in 1626 to secure their control for trade in the increasingly valuable harbor. At that time, the Dutch depended upon the native people &#8211; not only for pelts sold throughout Europe, but for their very survival. Native knowledge of the area and the trade routes was indispensable. However, Fort Amsterdam soon became the site of frequent conflict between the Dutch and native people. It was also the site of battles between the Dutch and other Europeans. In 1664, the Dutch lost the island to the English, who renamed it New York.<br><br>
Since nearby Wall Street was named for a wall built in 1653 by the Dutch settlers to keep out the &#8220;northern Indians&#8221; (probably Manicans and Munsees), it is ironic that the US Custom House should again become a gathering place and a center for peaceful cultural exchange between the native people of the Americas and the world. Here, near the crowded, shouting financial market of Wall Street, the many living and colorful marketplaces of the native world converge again, this time at the National Museum of the American Indian.]]></desc>

The approximately one million objects in the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) collection were amassed by George Gustav Heye (1874-1957). The collection spans the Western Hemisphere from the Arctic to Tiera del Fuego and from California to the Caribbean. In 1989, through an act of Congress, NMAI became part of the Smithsonian Institution, the largest museum complex in the world.<br><br>
NMAI’s George Gustav Heye Center, at the Alexander Hamilton US Custom House, is only one of the three sites comprising the museum. Plans are underway for a museum building near the Capitol in Washington, DC, which will be the public cornerstone of NMAI. Because of its immensity, however, much of the collection will reside in Suitland, Maryland, where objects will be housed, viewed, and used by native peoples for many purposes, including ceremonial rite and artistic reference.<br><br>
Dedicated to educating the public about the diversity and vitality of native cultures throughout the western Hemisphere, the museum actively supports the involvement of native communities in the management of their own cultural resources. A &#8220;Fourth Museum&#8221; exists in the form of outreach and training within native communities. Like a tree that draws its strength from many roots, the shape of the Fourth Museum is as varied and flexible as the needs and wished of native communities, tribal cultural centers, schools, libraries and individuals.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[George Gustav Heye<br><br>
George Gustav Heye, founder in 1916 of the Museum of the American Indian and its director until 1956, was unique in both his enthusiasm and his broad interest in native life. His passion for collecting began in 1896, when he purchased an Apache deerskin shirt on a railroad construction job in Arizona. From then his energy and inherited fortune were spent accumulating the largest private collection of Native American objects in the world.<br><br>
Heye liked nothing better than to descend personally upon an American Indian community, buying everything in sight. While others focused on highly significant objects, Heye wasn’t satisfied until he’d brought every last object and shipped everything back to New York. As one Native American is reported to have said, remembering a visit from the museum’s founder: &#8220;If we were left with our underwear we were lucky!&#8221;<br><br>
That scope makes Heye’s collection uniquely valuable as a material record of those native communities. As Linda Poolaw, Delaware Grand Chief, says, &#8220;If Gustav Heye hadn’t collected those things back then, we would not have then today to look at. Now, over a hundred years later, my people can see what we had, and it is not lost.&#8221;]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Biography of Dr. Sun Yat-sen]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Baxter Street, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Dr. Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866 to a Cantonese family in Tsuei-Heng Village, Shiangshan County, Kwangtung Province in China, under the rule of the Ching Dynasty. His early education in China, Hawaii and Hong Kong established him as a man of two worlds &#8211; China and the West. He also learned the essentials about freedom and democracy in the Western World, and these became the guiding principles he followed for the rest of his life.<br><br>
During his teenage years, Dr. Sun grew increasingly angry and disappointed in the rule of the corrupt and inefficient Ching Dynasty. The spirit of the American Revolution and Independence had a lasting effect on him and sparked his goals for the creation of an Ideal China with freedom and democracy. He came to the conclusion that in order to achieve those noble goals, the people in China would have to overthrow the Ching Dynasty. Thus, he decided to become a foremost pioneer to reform China by leading the revolution. Dr. Sun founded the Hsing-Chung Hui (Revive China Society), a secret revolutionary organization, when he traveled to Hawaii. Later, he organized the Tung-Meng Hui (Revolutionary Alliance) and was elected its first director. He spent over 20 years traveling in the U.S.A., Canada, Japan and other foreign countries to promote his philosophy and to organize uprisings to overthrow the ultra-conservative Ching Dynasty. After many armed uprisings, Dr. Sun and his allies successfully overthrew the Ching Dynasty in a revolution in 1911 that ended 5,000 years of Imperial rule in China.<br><br>
Dr. Sun was subsequently elected the first President of the Republic of China. He established the organizational rule of government and the basic laws of the land. However, his term in office was brief: the military warlords in Northern China forced him to step down in 1912. Afterward, Dr. Sun continued to fight against warlords for a free and unified China. He proclaimed his &#8220;Three Principles of the People&#8221; &#8211; Nationalism, Democracy and the People’s Livelihood &#8211; as the foundation of the country. He also produced the Five-Yuan Constitution as the guideline for the political system and bureaucracy for a new China.<br><br>
In March 12, 1925, Dr. Sun died of liver cancer in Beijing at the age of 59. But his deeds will never be forgotten. Throughout China, and the rest of the world, Dr. Sun is remembered for his bravery and wisdom, and to many he is worshipped as a true Saint &#8211; a near perfect human being! Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s name and deeds will remain forever in the hearts and minds of Chinese people everywhere!]]></desc>

It is Georgian in style, with the steeply pitched end gables, rich entablature and quoins, and rectangular plan with the tower set forward. The etched window heads, however, are reminiscent of English Gothic parish churches. In 1853, the Roman Catholic Church of the Transfiguration brought the church, at which time it was remodeled and the bell tower replaced.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
The early 1800s was a tumultuous time below Canal Street in the downtown area of Manhattan. The Great Fire of 1835 destroyed entire neighborhoods and at least two cholera outbreaks occurred. Upwardly mobile protestants were leaving the area for safer communities up North. And, a tremendous influx of poor Catholic immigrants occurred from Ireland beginning around 1845.<br><br>
During the time of the cataclysmic events, the parish Church of the Transfiguration moved from #33 Ann Street to #45 Ann Street to #45 Chambers Street and finally to #29 Mott Street.<br><br>
When the founder of the Church of the Transfiguration parish, Father Felix Varela, retired for health reasons, he left the New York parish in the hands of his assistant, Father John McClellan. Father McClellan needed a larger church. He sold the Transfiguration church building on Chambers Street and bought the Zion Protestant Episcopal Church on Mott Street. In 1853, Bishop John Hughes dedicated and named the building the Church of the Transfiguration<br><br><br>
The venerable Felix Varela y Morales was an apostle for American immigrants and the founding pastor of The Church of the Transfiguration.<br><br>
Felix Varela was born on November 20. 1788 in Cuba, then part of New Spain. He studied at the San Carlos Seminary. A highly intelligent student, Varela was named Professor of Philosophy at the Seminary of San Carlos and San Ambrosio of Havana in 1811. In the same year be became a priest.<br><br>
In Cuba, Father Varela was the leading educator, philosopher, and patriot of his time. He taught philosophy, chemistry, physics, theology and music to many future Cuban leaders. He advocated giving women the same education that men received.<br><br>
In 1821, Father Varela was elected to represent Cuba in the Spanish legislature. Varela recommended the Spanish colonies in Latin America be considered independent from Spain. he asked for Cuban self-rule and an end to slavery.<br><br>
Two years later, considered an enemy of the autocratic government of Ferdinand VII, he was condemned to death by the Spanish Crown. Before he could be arrested, he escaped and made his way to New York, where he arrived in December 1823.<br><br>
Shortly after working as an assistant to Pastor John Powers, Vicar General of the Diocese of New York, Father Varela was asked to form a &#8220;basement congregation&#8221; in lower Manhattan. This was in response to a growing number of Irish Catholic immigrants in the community. Over the next 25 years, the basement congregation grew to become the church of immigrants &#8211; The Church of the Transfiguration.<br><br>
In 1837, Varela was named Vicar General of the Diocese of New York. He served as a theological consultant to the committee of American Bishops that drew up the famous Baltimore Catechism, a standard teaching tool for Catholic children in the nation until the mid-20th century.<br><br>
Father Felix Varela died on February 25, 1853 in St. Augustine, Florida. His remains were moved to Havana in 1912 and placed in Aula Magna of Havana University. In 1988, on the bicentennial of his birth, the U.S. Postal Service issued a $0.32 stamp in his name.<br><br>
On Easter Sunday, April 8, 2012, the Vatican’s Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Father Varela &#8220;Venerable&#8221;, meaning he had lived a virtuous life within the Catholic faith to a heroic degree, and as such, is worthy of praise. Father Varela was declared a servant of God and is being considered for a canonization as a Catholic saint.<br><br><br>
The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato Famine, between 1845 and 1852 was responsible for both the death of over one million people in Ireland and the emigration from Ireland of over a million more. One thousand of those Irish immigrants arrived in New York each day in 1847. Many of these emigrants settled in the Five Points.<br><br>
Before the Irish arrived, Charles Dickens described the Five Points in his American Notes: &#8220;This is the place, these narrow ways, diverging to the right and left, and reeking everything everywhere with dirt and filth … Debauchery has made the very houses prematurely old … hideous tenements which take their name from robbery and murder, all that is loathsome, drooping, and decaying is here.&#8221;<br><br>
The Five Points, New York City’s most notorious slum, was part of The Church of the Transfiguration parish community from 1853 on.<br><br>
The Five Points got its name from its center where three streets converged; that is, approximately where Baxter Street and Worth Streets meet today. This area was a haven for freed slaves and immigrants joined by the most disreputable and forgotten people of the City. While sailors added a certain color to the neighborhood and prostitutes a bawdy notoriety, this area was a decayed, diseased and a violent collection of hovels where despair and hopelessness were a way of life. Paradise Square, the Old Brewery (which averaged a murder a night), the Den of Thieves and Murderer’s Row were places where gangs, such as the Plug Uglies and the Dead Rabbits, transacted their business.<br><br>
Father Felix Varela and their successors started parish aid societies, taught many to read and write, formed a temperance union that numbered over a thousand men and helped refresh people’s sense of worth and dignity in the Five Points.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Welcome to Columbus Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Worth Street, New York, (On the right when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Columbus Park was named in 1911 after Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), the Italian explorer credited with discovering America, or at least with awakening Europe to the opportunities there. Bounded by Baxter (formerly Orange), Worth (formerly Anthony), Bayard, and Mulberry Streets, the site has alternatively been named Mulberry Bend Park, Five Points Park, and Paradise Park. Situated in the heart of one of the oldest residential areas in Manhattan, adjacent to the infamous "Five Points" and "The Bend&#8221;, Columbus Park Stands at the crossroads of the history and culture of New York City. <br>
Until 1808 the swampy area was near the Collect Pond (now Foley Square) and hosted a set of tanneries. In 1808 the pond was filled and became Pearl Street. When the filling began to sink, the odor became foul and the buildings depressed. As a consequence, the area became host to one of the world's most notorious tenements, known for its wretched living conditions and rampant crime, earning such names as "murderer's alley" and "den of thieves." <br><br>

In 1842, on a visit to the United States, English author Charles Dickens made sure to visit the notorious Five Points, and he wrote about it in his American Notes in the most scathing terms. He described it as "reeking everywhere with dirt and filth," concluding that "all that is loathsome, drooping and decayed is here." But it was in the 1890’s, when plans for the construction of a park were already underway, that the area's notoriety achieved new heights. Danish newspaperman Jacob Riis devoted an entire chapter of his epic How the Other Half Lives to "The Bend," detailing the "foul core of New York's slums." He likened the filth and dearth of sunlight to a "vast human pig-sty," claiming that "There is but one 'Bend' in the world, and that is enough." <br><br>

But beneath the harsh criticism of the 19th century figures, there is a redeeming quality brought out in Riis that has been substantiated by recent urban archeological projects. For all its roughness and difficult conditions, Five Points mixed the residential, commercial, and industrial elements in an unprecedented fashion, bringing together a wide array of immigrants. In the 1840s, Baxter Street became host to German Jews and New York's first garment district. Meanwhile, the neighborhood gained the strongest Irish presence outside of Dublin itself. In the 1880s, a large Italian population arrived, populating an adjacent neighborhood that remains to this day. Immigrants used Five Points as a stepping stone to a better life in a new land and one can now view the area not as a wretched slum but a vibrant multi-ethnic microcosm of New York as a whole. As Walt Whitman wrote in 1842, (the same year as Dickens), the inner-city residents are "not paupers and criminals, but the Republic's most needed asset, the wealth of stout poor men who will work." <br><br>

In the 20th century, the area around Five Points was subsumed by a sprawling Chinatown, as the latest generation of new immigrants contributed to the long culture of beginning afresh in Manhattan's historic downtown. The residents of the area around Five Points have always served as a paragon of hard work and the drive to succeed. <br><br>

Mulberry Bend Park was planned in the 1880’s by Calvert Vaux, co-designer of Central Park. Vaux saw it as an opportunity to bring new life and order into the depressed neighborhood. Riis remarked of Vaux’s newly designed park that it is "little less than a revolution" to see the slum housing go down, while &#8220;In its place will come trees and grass and flowers: for its dark hovels light and sunshine and air.&#8221; The park opened in the summer of 1897, with bench-lined curved walkways and an expansive, open grassy area. <br><br>

It was one of the city's first major urban parks, and was home to such events as "Interpark Playground Basket Ball," then played by youth segregated by weight class, as described by the Park Commission in 1913. Throughout its life, the dynamic park has undergone many changes and much reconstruction. In 1934 a limestone recreation center was erected, which is now a comfort station. In the 1980s the construction of new playground equipment and the addition of basketball courts was undertaken. In 1990 work was completed on the pavement and the flagpole. In 1999 two new pieces of play equipment were installed, as well as new paving and safety surfacing. A medley of planting has been done regularly throughout the life of the park. The area continues to be a gathering place for people of different cultures and ages, and hosts a wide variety of events and assemblies.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Collect Pond Park<br>
.994 acre<br><br>
Located on Leonard Street between Centre and Lafayette Streets, this park occupies the eighteenth century site of Collect Pond. The pond was a large, 60-foot deep pool fed by an underground spring. The waters derived their name from seventeenth century Dutch settlers, who called it &#8220;kolch&#8221; meaning &#8220;small body of water&#8221;. Following the English capture of New Amsterdam (1664), the name was corrupted to &#8220;collect&#8221;. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Collect Pond was a favorite spot for picnics and ice-skating. In 1796, John Finch (1743-1798) launched one of the first experimental steamboats on the waters. During this time, the pond was still clean enough to use for the area’s drinking water. By the early nineteenth century, however, New York City had transformed the sparkling waters into a communal open sewer. Disgusted, local authorities initiated a project to fill the sewer with earth from an adjacent hill. In 1805, in order to drain the garbage-infested waters, designers opened a forty-foot wide canal that today is known as Canal Street.<br><br>
By 1811, the City had completed the filling of Collect Pond. A neighbor known as Paradise Square soon arose over the pond’s previous site. Unfortunately, due to the area’s extremely high water table, Paradise Square began to sink in the 1820’s. The neighborhood also began to emit a foul odor, prompting the most affluent residents to leave the community. By the 1830’s, Paradise Square had become the notorious &#8220;Five Points&#8221;. an extremely poor and dangerous neighborhood renowned for its crime and filth.<br><br>
Five streets comprised the &#8220;Five Points&#8221;, giving the neighborhood its name: Mulberry Street, Anthony (present-day Worth Street, Cross (present-day Mosco) Street, Orange (present-day Baxter) Street, and Little Water Street (no longer exists). Numerous criminal gangs roamed the neighborhood, extorting money from residents and running prostitution rings. Many early twentieth century criminals, such as Lucky Luciano (1897-1962) and Al Capone (1899-1947), had their start in &#8220;Five Points&#8221; street gangs. Crime was only one half of the story in the &#8220;Five Points&#8221;: the high population density of the neighborhood and the existence of a subterranean swamp precipitated the outbreak of disease. Throughout the nineteenth century, nearly all of the city’s cholera outbreaks originated in the neighborhood.<br><br>
The squalid conditions of the &#8220;Five Points&#8221; soon began to end after the 1890 publication of How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob Riis (1849-1914). Riis’ work was a revealing account of slum life on the Lower East Side that disturbed late-nineteenth century reformers. Within four years of the book’s appearance, the City of New York had condemned nearly all the tenements that comprised the area, ridding the community of crime and filth. The revived area is now known as the Civic Center, due to the presence of many governmental offices.<br><br>
On April 28, 1960, the Board of Estimate placed the property under Parks jurisdiction. The property was formerly known as Civic Court Park due to the plethora of judiciary institutions throughout the neighborhood; the Criminal Court, Civil Court, and Family Court are all visible from this parkland. The park boasts a large, green open area circumscribed by benches and trees. Commissioner Stern changed the property’s name from Civil Court Park to Collect Pond Park, thereby providing the area with a well-deserved sense of character and history.<br><br>

If you were standing here in the early 1600s, you would have seen a sparkling expanse of water spreading out over five acres. There was a pond here sixty feet deep, fed by a subterranean springs and ringed by wooded hills, that drained through marshy outlets to the Hudson and East Rivers. People from Lenape tribes camped by the pond’s southern shores.<br><br>
Dutch settlers called the pond <i>Versch Water</i> of simply the <i>kolch</i> (meaning pond). English colonial successors used both names, translating the first as ‘the Fresh Water&#8221; and anglicizing the later as ‘the Collect’.<br><br>
As the city grew and rapidly displaced nature, the fresh Collect Pond became degraded and was later buried beneath the metropolis.<br><br>]]></desc>

When New York was a small town at the southern tip of Manhattan, Collect Pond was a place for recreation: fishing in the summer and skating in the winter. Fishing in the pond was so popular that in 1734 the city banned nets, allowing people only to use hook and line.<br><br>
Eventually, however, the pond was fouled by industrial uses and pressures from the advancing population. Tanneries, slaughterhouses, and other noxious industries that utilized large amounts of fresh water began to locate near the pond in the 1690s.<br><br>
Area residents also contributed to the pollution, leading to a 1778 ban on laundering in the pond, which was largely ignored. In 1785, the <i>New York Journal</i> reported &#8220;suds and filth are emptied into this pond, besides dead dogs, cats, etc. thrown in daily, and no doubt, many buckets (of bodily waste) from that quarter of town.&#8221;]]></desc>

By 1796, a city engineer deemed Collect Pond to be stagnant and foul. A plan emerged to cleanse the pond and reconstruct it as a ship harbor with a channel to the Hudson River, but that plan was rejected. Instead, in 1803, the city decided to bury the pond.<br><br>
At first, the pond was filled with clean soil cut from the hills around it. But as the years passed, the spring-fed pond refused to disappear, so carters were paid to dump anything, including garbage, into the pond site.<br><br>
By 1808, mud and rubbish formed a mound of several acres that loomed over the remaining water. An 1812 grand jury determined that the pond contained &#8220;great quantities of stagnant water…dead animals and filth of all kinds.&#8221;]]></desc>

After Collect Pond was buried, various legends arose.<br><br>
Legend 1: The pond supplied the city’s drinking water.<br>
It did not. However, the city’s subterranean springs, which were the source of the pond’s water, fed two other water supply systems. The Tea Water Pump southeast of the pond provided water from the 1740s until 1800, by which time it had become too polluted. In 1799, Aaron Burr’s Manhattan Company sunk wells just south of the pond and these provided water for 40 years, although of poor quality. New Yorkers drank from these sources, as well as hundreds of neighborhood wells, until the Croton Aqueduct, which carried pure water from Westchester, was completed in 1842.<br><br>
Legend 2: England’s future King William IV nearly drowned while skating on the pond in 1782.<br>
This was first reported in an 1869 biography; in fact, the prince had been pushed around the frozen pond on a blade-fitted chair without incident.<br><br>
Legend 3: Steam pioneer John Fitch tested a steamboat on the pond in 1796.<br>
The legend was created in 1846 by a Fitch promoter. Though his fanciful account is often repeated, no evidence has been found to substantiate the story.]]></desc>

The long process of burying Collect Pond was completed by the mid-1810s, but its watery legacy remained. Streets laid over the former pond created a neighborhood that was briefly fashionable but quickly declined after the filled-in pond began to sink and release putrid gases. The area eventually became the notorious Five Points district, the nation’s first great slum.<br>
The squalid Five Points neighborhood gradually gave way to an expanding Civic Center. The first large building on the site contained the New York Halls of Justice and House of Detention. It was constructed over a dense foundation of hemlock piles; nevertheless, the building sagged and stank, even before it opened in 1838. So did its successor (opened in 1902, demolished in 1941). Both occupied the block where this park is now, on the northwest quadrant of the old Collect Pond.<br><br>
The property has since been stabilized and was placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation in 1960. The water feature of the current park, which opened in 2012, recalls the pond that one occupied this site.]]></desc>

2.610 acres<br><br>
Bounded by Cherry, Pike, and Monroe Streets, Coleman Square Playground lies on the border between Chinatown and the Lower East Side. It is named in honor of U.S, Army Corporal Joseph Francis Coleman (d. 1919), son of Thomas Coleman and Mary Hurley. before World War I, the Coleman family resided on nearby Madison Street. Coleman fought in France as a member of the 321st Field Artillery, the 82nd Division of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). He died on June 16, 1919 at Base Hospital in Hoboken, New Jersey, after contracting tuberculosis in the trenches. Exactly six months after Coleman’s death, the Board of Aldermen named this playground in tribute to him.<br><br>
The land that Coleman Square Playground now occupies was once the graveyard of St. Steven’s Episcopal Church. Founded in 1804, the church once stood at the corner of Chrystie Street and Broome Street. Sixty-two years after it was built, with a declining population and insufficient funds, St. Steven’s was sold. After being exhumed from the cemetery, two thousand bodies were moved across the East River by boat and reburied in Cyprus Hills Cemetery. Unfortunately, since only 250 families paid to have the names of their deceased relatives listed, most of the names have been lost to posterity.<br><br>
Part of Coleman Square Playground stands under the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, a two-level steel suspension bridge designed by Leon Moisseiff (1871-1904) and completed in 1909. The bridge is 6.855 feet long, with a main span of 1,470 feet. The architectural firm of Carrere and Hastings designed the grand arch and flanking colonnades that mark the entrance to the bridge on Canal Street.<br><br>
Acquired by condemnation and by purchase in six parcels between 1897 and 1950, Coleman Square Playground includes a large playground and a grassy ballfield. Between 1907 and 1969,m Parks assumed jurisdiction over the various parcels of land. By 1970, the park reached its present size. In 1994, the ballfield was named Phylis M. Ammirati ballfield in honor of the founder of the park’s women’s softball league. Taken all together, Coleman Square Playground in not only a place of rest and recreation for people of all ages, but also a memorial to a neighborhood boy who fought in the Great War.<br><br>

This park, located at the intersection of St. James Place, Oliver, Madison, and James Streets bordering the Civic Center, Chinatown, and Lower East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan, takes its name from nearby St. James Roman Catholic Church. The Church is named after St. James the Greater, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus, and one of the Christian faith’s most enduring figures.<br><br>
Since the early 17th century, Lower Manhattan has been home to generations of immigrants. In 1643, a French Jesuit priest, visiting New York, identified 18 distinct different languages being spoken throughout the city. Less than fifty years later, the island’s religious communities boasted a Jewish temple, several Quaker, Presbyterian, and Independent churches as well as an Anglican church. With the close of the American Revolution, Manhattan served both as the new nation’s gateway for immigration and as a vital port of mercantile commerce. By the mid-1800s, new residents, largely the poor and immigrant populace, began filtering into the Lower East Side’s dilapidated and cramped tenement houses to suffer for a day’s wage in the neighborhood sweatshops and on the nearby docks.<br><br>
In 1836, St. James Roman Catholic Church began to serve the neighborhood’s largely immigrant Lower East Side community. Built atop the foundation of one of the neighborhood’s oldest breweries, the parish quickly became an influential part of the neighborhood. Dedicated to serving the poor and indigent of their community, the priests of St. James also often cared for cholera patients stranded aboard nearby quarantined vessels; several priests contracted the disease and died shortly after their patients. During the Civil War, the priests of St. James blessed the regimental colors of the Fighting 69th and, around the same time, championed the cause of Catholic temperance in a bid to end local alcohol abuse, ignoring the critical attitudes and admonitions of contemporary Protestant reformers.<br><br>
In March 1961, Bernard Baruch (1870-1965), A Polish immigrant, successful New York financier, and donator of several large grants to New York City’s ongoing development and restoration projects, gave $30,000 to Parks for the creation of this sitting area. Adjoining the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish Cemetery, one of the oldest Jewish cemeteries (1682) in the United States, the site’s previous structures, a parking garage and tenement, were rapidly demolished and replaced with benches and greenery. A bronze plaque was placed on a nearby wall in 1965 to commemorate Bernard Baruch’s efforts on behalf of one of New York City’s oldest neighborhoods. Renovations occurred in 2000, including sidewalk repaving and other site improvements, with $47,617 allocated by Mayor Giuliani.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
&#8220;To see the Bowery in its glory, one must visit it at night. It is a blazer of light from one end to the other.&#8221;<br>
-James D.McCabe, <i>New York by Sunlight and Gaslight</i>, 1882<br><br>
Originally a Native American footpath, Dutch farm road (<i>bouwerji</i> means farm), and lower stretch of the Boston Post Road, the Bowery is NYC’s oldest thoroughfare. It has seen nearly every type of transportation from stagecoaches and street cars to elevated trains and automobiles. Its most famous travelers were General Washington and his troops, who triumphantly marched down the Bowery as British troops evacuated Manhattan on November 25, 1783.<br><br>
America’s first streetcars, which were horse-drawn, began runs on Bowery between Prince and 14th Street in 1832. In 1878, one of the city’s first elevated train lines was constructed above the Bowery’s sidewalks. Shadows cast by &#8220;the El&#8221; ands soot from its steam engines made an already gritty street more so. Nonetheless, when Edison electrified the street in 1882, the effect at night was said to be dazzling.<br><br>
The majestic approach to the Manhattan bridge is considered one of the most beautiful in the country. Completed in 1915, it was designed by Carrere and Hastings, with its triumphal Beaux Arts arch and colonnade patterned after the Porte St. Denis in Paris and the Bernini columns in Rome.]]></desc>

The architectural significance of this church, built in 1817 on land donated by Colonel Henry Rutgers, a Revolutionary War patriot, is its introduction, at an early date, of Gothic design as seen in its pointed-arch windows and doorways. First owned by the Dutch Reformed Church and later the Presbyterian Church, this building was known for years as the Sea and Land Church because it served local seamen. In 1951, it was shared by the First Chinese Presbyterian Church and recently, the New York Presbytery donated the building to this congregation as a memorial to the Christian dedication of the Chinese community.<br><br>

Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are national monuments of transcendent importance, fraternal twins celebrating America’s immigrant history. The Statue of Liberty offers the ideal: the welcome extended to &#8220;the huddled masses yearning to breathe free&#8221; immortalized in Emma Lazarus’s poem, chiseled in its base. Ellis Island offers the real: the gritty, difficult, miraculous place where millions of immigrants from all corners of the globe entered the New World. Today, one hundred million Americans can trace some part of their family history through Ellis Island. From 1892 to 1953, as many as ten thousand immigrants in a day, some 12 million in all, exhausted from weeks of ocean travel in often hideous conditions, lined up for the inspection that determined whether they would enter the New World &#8211; or be sent back home. Both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island’s main building have been stunningly restored, thanks to the vision of the National Parks Service, and the fundraising efforts of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation.]]></desc>

This address once hosted the headquarters of the Bowery Boys, a mid-nineteenth century nativist gang popularized in the book and fictional Martin Scorsese film, Gangs of New York. This coterie of American-born, anti-immigrant firefighting brawlers often violently exerted their perceived sovereignty over newcomers during one of the most lawless and corrupt eras in New York City history.<br><br>
By the 1850s, the primary targets of the Bowery Boys’ resentment were the newly-arrived Irish laborers of the neighboring Five Points district. Shortly after midnight on July 4, 1857, this location was attacked by a coalition of Five Points gangs, including the Irish Dead Rabbits gang, which sparked a fierce two day battle between rival factions. In the end, eight rioters were killed and dozens injured.<br><br>
Note; While popular culture emphasizes the gang violence and thuggery, most early gangs, especially immigrant gangs, were initially created in part to promote their community’s interests or to provide services, like firefighting, not yet supplied by the city.<br><br>

&#8220;The 3000-seat Bowery Theatre opened here in 1826 as America’s largest theatre. The first gaslit theatre, its massive stage used fire and water effects, and held horses for battle scenes.<br><br>
Its Roman temple exterior hoped to lure the genteel elite, but its pit and upper tiers were soon filled by the area’s working class, who flocked to see Shakespeare, melodrama, comedy and song. Walt Whitman fondly remembered presidents being seated beside mechanics and tradesmen.<br><br>
 Legendary appearances included Junius Brutus Booth, Charlotte Cushman, Dan Rice, Buffalo Bill, Edwin Forrest, James O’Neill, Emma Goldman, Lola Montez, magician J.H. Anderson and Bertha Kalich as Hamlet. In 1827, Madame Francisque Hutin scandalized Americans with their first glimpse of ballet.<br><br>
African American William Henry Lane &#8211; the King of all Dancers &#8211; electrified audiences with a fusion of the African American shuffle and the Irish jig, worked out from challenge dances in the Five Points ghetto. In addition to appearances by Black performers, and many productions of the anti-slavery play, <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, this theatre also launched T.D. Rice’s phenomenally successful &#8220;Jump Jim Crow&#8221; act, which mimicked Southern Black song and dance. Rice’s Jim Crow inspired the institution of blackface minstrel troupes, and became the namesake for the oppressive racial segregation laws after the Civil War.<br><br>
Opening in 1826 with the aptly-titled <i>The Road to Ruin</i>, this &#8220;unluckiest of theaters,&#8221; burned six times, but survived 103 years by catering to changing demographics &#8211; Germans, Jews, Irish, Italians and Chinese. It closed for good in 1929.<br><br>

On November 25, 1783, as the British withdrew from Manhattan, General Washington and his troops marched across the still rural island and down the Bowery. Stopping at the Bull’s Head Tavern to rest, they were met by throngs of jubilant citizens and raised their glasses before marching further south into the city, to celebrate what became known as Evacuation Day, the end of the Revolutionary War.<br><br>
Established circa 1755 in a butchers’ district, the tavern’s adjacent stockyard featured bear-and-bull-baiting. In the early 1800s, German-born owner Henry Astor exhibited &#8220;Old Bet&#8221;, the second elephant in America. Bull’s Head survived into the 1820s, patronized by writer Washington Irving<br><br>
In 1858, this site became the Atlantic Garden, a grand beer and entertainment hall serving German immigrants of the area’s <i>Kleindeutchland</i> (&#8220;Little Germany&#8221;). One of the few Bowery venues considered suitable for families, it was famous for its ladies’ orchestra, the first of its kind in the U.S. Entertainment featured African American musicians Cole and Johnson and the premiere of the Gay 90s song, &#8220;Daisy Bell (A Bicycle built for Two).&#8221;<br><br>
Popular for over half a century, the Atlantic Garden ended its days with Yiddish vaudeville and boxing matches before finally closing around 1915.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><br>
As one of the most famous and respected black abolitionist leaders of the 19th century, Frederick Douglass inspired many people through his courage and determination<br><br>

Frederick Bailey was born a slave in February 1818 on Holmes Hill Farm in Maryland. As a child he recognized that the ability to read and write could be his pathway to freedom. Through the tutelage of his &#8220;unsuspecting&#8221; mistress he garnered these skills, and eventually used them to escape his bondage. He landed at approximately this location, on the shores of New York City on September 4, 1838. To avert the attention of the slave catchers he changed his name to Frederick Douglass and found work as a common laborer in New Bedford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

In three decades prior to the Civil War, Frederick Douglas impassioned by the abolitionist movement, soon became known as one of America’s premiere champions of freedom for the oppressed. As a major station master for the Underground Railroad, he provided sanctuary to hundreds of runaway slaves. He gained world fame when his autobiography, <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</i> was published in 1845. Two tears later he began publication of <i>The North Star</i>, an antislavery newspaper. As editor of the nation’s best known African-American newspaper, he freely attacked the system of slavery with all the powers of his intellect. On July 28, 1848 after attending the Woman’s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, <i>The North Star</i> carried this quote:<br><br>
<i>&#8221;Standing as we do upon the watch-tower of human freedom, we cannot be deterred from an expression of our approbation of any movement, however, humble, to improve and elevate the character and condition of any members of the human family.&#8221;</i><br><br>

On January 1, 1863, his efforts, along with those of fellow abolitionists were acknowledged with the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. By war’s end, over 200,000 blacks had fought for their freedom. And by the spring of 1870, with the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, African Americans had attained the right to vote.<br><br>

In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Frederick Douglass Minister to Haiti. Frederick Douglass died on February 20, 1895 in Washington, D.C. His legacy as a champion of human rights lives on, and serves as a continued source of inspiration in the pursuit of equality.<br><br>

<i>Right is of no Sex &#8211; Truth is of no Color &#8211; God if the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren.&#8221;</i><br>

97 Bowery<br><br>
You are standing in front of an Italianate-style NYC landmark that was built in 1869 for the carriage manufacturer John P. Jube & Co. Its façade is constructed entirely of cast iron, a mid-to-late 19th-century architectural material popular in the city because of its low cost, strength, durability, supposedly fireproof nature, ease of assembly and parts replacement, ability to provide inexpensive ornament, and paintable surfaces.<br><br>
Designed in imitation of masonry, 97 Bowery’s large, arched window openings provided much-needed daylight and ventilation for the factory’s workers. The John P. Jube Company, which closed in 1935, was one of the city’s longest-running carriage manufacturers. It is a reminder of the significant role that horse-drawn carriages played in the everyday lives of 19th century New Yorkers.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Bowery, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Whether P.T. Barnum said it or not, &#8220;there’s a sucker born every minute&#8221; certainly applies to the throngs that lined up at Bowery and Division Street in 1836 for his first big bamboozle &#8211; the exhibition of slave woman Joice Heth, the supposed 46-pound, 161-year-old former nurse to America’s first president. Popular with audiences, Heth smoked a pipe, sang Baptist hymns and reminisced about baby George. To lure the skeptics, Barnum also exploited one critic’s theory that Heath was actually a clever combination of automation and ventriloquism.<br><br>
By his own admission, he bought the blind, toothless, partially paralyzed old woman for $1,000. Given the 10-hour shifts and multi-state touring schedule, he almost certainly hastened her death within just a few months of purchase. An autopsy, which Barnum sold tickets to, suggested she was probably not over 80.<br><br>
The Bowery was the young Barnum’s stomping ground. In addition to Heth, he exhibited song and dance acts at Vauxhall Garden (Bowery at Cooper Square), wrote advertising hype for the Bowery Amphitheatre (37 Bowery), and tried manufacturing and selling bear’s grease hair-loss ointment at 101 Bowery. Barnum had his portrait mass produced at Charles Eisenman’s photography studio (229 Bowery) and spoke at Cooper Union’s Great Hall.<br><br>
Even after hitting the big time with Barnum’s Museum on Broadway, his influence continued to be felt at the dime museums that lined the Bowery, offering in miniature the exotic exhibits and stage shows that made his museum the wonder of the age.<br><br>

On this site in the mid-1800s, stood the German Winter Garden (aka Volks Garden), a forgotten treasure of mid-19th century New York’s <i>Kleindeutschland</i>, then the third most dense concentration of Germans in the world. Known for its music and family-friendly ambiance, it was one of several stately German theatres, banks and beer gardens on the Bowery, Little Germany’s cultural hub. built circa 1855, the Winter Garden’s glass-encased dome was one of the first to use cast-iron rib framing.<br><br>
In 1864, the structure was replaced by the 3,500 seat New Stadt Theatre, which became the Windsor Theatre in 1878. Billed as the &#8220;Largest Theatre in America&#8221;, it alternated over the years between German drama, classical music and opera. Yiddish theatre, and plays by Shakespeare and Ireland’s Dion Boucicault. Appearing there were &#8220;Buffalo Bill&#8221; Cody, Italian actor Antonio Maiori, Jacob Adler as the Jewish King Lear, magic legend Herrmann the Great and matinee idol James O’Neill (Eugene’s father) in <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>. Decades before Broadway became integrated, one could also have seen Callender’s Minstrels, an African American minstrel troupe, featuring America’s first widely popular Black comedian, Billy Nersands.<br><br>
In 1910, the Windsor was torn down to make way for the Manhattan Bridge Plaza.<br>

On this spot in 1833 stood the Zoological Institute, one of America’s first menageries. Expanding to include equestrian and circus acts, it became the Bowery Amphitheatre. Acts here included the famous clown W.F. Wallett, and &#8220;the great Lion Tamer&#8221; Issac Van Amburgh, believed to be the first to stick his head into the mouth of a lion.<br><br>
On February 6, 1842, the Amphitheatre saw the first performance of the Virginia Minstrels, four Northern White men in blackface who created the first group minstrel show. An influential theatrical genre for over 100 years, minstrelsy was a supposed recreation of Southern Black music, dance and joke telling. Though it popularized a harmful parade of racist stereotypes, minstrelsy was nonetheless and institution through which characteristically American forms of music, song and dance emerged.<br><br>
With the Bowery the mid-1800s cultural center of <i>Kleindeutschland</i> (Little Germany), the theatre changed its name to the Stadt Theatre. From 1854 to the early 1860s, it alternated between English drama and presentations of German classical music and opera. Many German works had their American premieres on the Bowery, including Wagner’s <i>Tannhauser</i> at the Stadt in 1859.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
In the 1890s, this Bowery at Doyers Street corner was a gateway to the tiny but thriving Chinatown, even then a famed tourist destination. Squeezed between Bowery, Mott, Pell and Doyers Streets and dominated by Chinese shops and residents, it was also a multi-ethnic enclave, like the nearby Five Points.<br><br>
The local funeral parlor served both Irish and Chinese, and Chinese restaurants &#8211; unlike places uptown &#8211; welcomed African-American diners.<br><br>
Nicknamed the ‘Bloody Angle’, Doyers St was sometimes the scene of gangland battles, but primarily it was a place of culture and commerce, with famed artist Wong Kai Kee’s art store at 1 Doyers and the elegant Chinese-American Tuxedo restaurant on the corner at 2 Bowery. The Chinese Theatre at 5-7 Doyers, which presented Chinese opera, was popular with locals and a must-see stop on Bowery/Chinatown &#8220;slumming tours.&#8221;<br><br>
Noticeably absent were Chinese women. The discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Acts (1882-1943) severely restricted Chinese immigration and harshly limited the entry of Chinese women.<br><br>
Thus, Chinatown’s kinship associations became the center of Chinese American community life during these years. The Chinese Masonic Building at 22 Mott Street was where Dr. Sun Yat-sen raised funds for the 1911 overthrow of China’s imperial government.<br><br>

As a stomping ground for sailors and sporting men, the Bowery/Chatham Square was an appropriate location for Samuel O’Reilly and Charlie Wagner, the fathers of modern tattooing. O’Reilly, who patented the first electric tattooing machine in 1891, made a name for himself at 11 Chatham Square, as did his student Wagner, who took over when O’Reilly died in 1908. Known as the &#8220;Michelangelo of Tattoo,&#8221; he patented his own tattoo machine in 1904 featuring the same alignment many machines use today. Wagner also rented a space at 208 and 223 Bowery, but worked 11 Chatham Square until his death in 1953.<br><br>
Other Bowery tattoo artists, some Wagner protégés, included Willie Moscowitz & Al Neville (4,12 Bowery), Lame Leroy (15 Bowery), Apache Harry (22 Bowery), and Moskowitz’s sons, Stanley and Walter (52 Bowery). The most unique was Mildred Hull, &#8220;New York’s only lady tattooist.&#8221; Raised on the Bowery, Millie was an exotic circus dancer when Wagner started tattooing her and taught her his craft. Her Tattoo Emporium opened in 1939 inside a barber shop at 16 Bowery.<br><br>
Tattooers worked the Bowery until NYC banned tattooing in 1961. It wasn’t re-legalized until 1997.<br><br>

You are standing at the former site of the Five Spot Café, which in the 1950s and ‘60s was owned and operated by brothers Joe and Iggy Termini, who brought in the era’s most progressive jazz artists, including Thelonious Monk, Cecil Taylor, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, Randy Weston and John Coltrane.<br><br>
Some of Billie Holiday’s last performances took place here. Because the authorities had seized her cabaret card, the engagements could not be publicized, but the club filled up by word of mouth alone.<br><br>
In 1959, saxophonist Ornette Coleman’s Five Spot debut introduced free improvisation to mainstream jazz discourse. Although composer Leonard Bernstein visited one night and loudly declared it &#8220;the greatest thing that has ever happened in jazz,&#8221; Colman’s music remains controversial to this day.<br><br>
THE New York destination for bohemians and visiting intelligentsia, Five Spot regulars included painter Robert Rauschenberg, poets Ted Joans and Amiri Baraka, and novelists Jack Kerouac and James Baldwin. During the club’s existence, whether as listeners or as performers, the most adventurous artists of the time came through the Five Spot’s doors.<br><br>
In 1963, the club moved to Two St. Mark’s Place and Cooper Square, where it lasted until the early 1970’s.<br>

You are standing in front of an 1844 townhouse which was converted in the 1960s from a cold-water flop to home and gathering place for a newly developing, inclusive avant-garde. Poets Amiri Bakara and Hetty Jones hosted writers, painters, dancers, filmmakers, and musicians. At their notorious parties, you might have met Alan Ginsburg or Frank O’Hara or Larry Rivers or Jonas Mekas or Cecil Taylor. It was here that Baraka began the influential Black Arts Movement, a lasting inspiration for African American artists in all genres.<p>
Children flourished, pianos came in through windows, and saxophonist Archie Schepp’s rehearsals stopped traffic across Cooper Square. Elizabeth Murray stayed until her paintings were too large to navigate the steep, winding stairs. Later generations found their way here to break bread, argue art and politics, and continue to explore barrier-breaking forms of American art.]]></desc>

In the 1800’s this was the site of the New England Hotel, the final home of America’s first great popular songwriter, Stephen Foster (1826-1864). Foster composed over 200 songs, many of which have passed into the American Canon. They include &#8220;Camptown Races,&#8221; &#8220;Old Folks at Home,&#8221; &#8220;My Old Kentucky Home,&#8221; &#8220;Beautiful Dreamer,&#8221; &#8220;Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair,&#8221; and &#8220;Hard Times Come Again No More.&#8221; His &#8220;Oh Susanna,&#8221; forever changed the history of American popular song, selling over 100,000 copies at a time when the previous best selling song had sold no more than 5000 copies.<br><br>
Foster wrote most of his beat sellers for the minstrel stage. Born when the Virginia Minstrels formed in this hotel in 1843, minstrelsy was created by white men blacking up and pretending to represent African American plantation culture, with the central instrument being the banjo, which was derived from West Africa. Though it popularized Black stereotypes, minstrelsy swept America and by the 1860 there were thousands of troupes &#8211; even African America troupes &#8211; performing around the world.<br><br>
Alcoholism deeply affected Foster’s short, tragic life. he sold many of his best songs for a pittance. When he died in this hotel, he left an estate of less than one dollar.<br><br>

In 1881, Worth’s Museum and Congress of Living and Intimate Curiosities opened at 101 Bowery. Like other dime museums which lined the Bowery, Worth’s offered a variety of freakish amusements, such as the largest specimen of giant squid in North America and what was claimed to be the preserved head of Charles Julius Guiteau &#8211; the assassin of President James Garfield. Children who brought a live mouse to feed to the museum’s 54 rattlesnakes, (sic) were admitted for free.<br><br>
From 1876-1878, 103 Bowery was home to Bunnell’s New American Museum, founded by dime museum pioneer George Bunnell, a former assistant to P.T. Barnum. Like Barnum, he offered exotic exhibits and stage shows, but at cheap prices. Housed on three floors, visitors flocked to oddities like the &#8220;Two-Brained Baby,&#8221; preserved &#8220;Mermaids&#8221; (dead manatees) and Jo-Jo, &#8220;King of Dog-Faced Freaks&#8221; (a boy with the condition hypertrichosis). The first floor &#8220;Theatorium&#8221; offered snake charmers and sword-swallowers, as well as vaudeville and burlesque acts. The second floor was a live animal menagerie and the third floor housed a wax museum devoted to sinners called &#8220;Dante’s Inferno,&#8221; in which spectators were encouraged to sneer at hated public figures like robber baron Jay Gould and William &#8220;Boss&#8221; Tweed.<br><br>

An Ohio born expatriate in 1920s Paris, she became darkroom assistant to Man Ray and built a reputation as a portrait photographer of artists like James Joyce and Jean Cocteau. inspired by Eugene Atget who captured images of old Paris before it disappeared, she returned to New York in 1929 and began a decade long quest to photograph a similarly changing New York, contrasting with older neighborhoods that were soon to vanish.<br><br>
Seeing her gritty images of the Bowery, an official of the Federal Arts Project warned Abbott that &#8220;nice girls&#8221; don’t go to such places. To which she replied, &#8220;I’m not a nice girl. I’m a photographer.&#8221;<br><br>

You are standing in front of what was once George Geoghegan’s Saloon, NYC’s most notorious bare knuckle boxing saloon. An Irish-born street-slugger-turned-professional boxer, Geoghegan (pronounced gay-gen), used his fame and earnings from the ring to open this &#8220;sporting&#8221; house which allowed drunken brawlers &#8211; and even women &#8211; an opportunity to duke it out for cash prizes in the 12-foot boxing rings on each of its two floors. Frequented by prostitutes and pickpockets, and known for its &#8220;gorilla-like waiters&#8221; and 10 cent raw whiskey, one reporter referred to it as a &#8220;carnival of debauchery.&#8221;<br><br>
No stranger to violence, Geoghegan was involved in at least two shootings at this location. Though one incident resulted in the murder of a patron, the former boxing champion skirted all charges because of his political affiliations. Geoghegan’s was closed down in 1883 after it was discovered that children as young as ten-years old were frequenting the bar. Owney served a short time in prison for the offence, and died a short time later, in 1885, of natural causes. This Renaissance Revival building later housed the Windsor Dime Museum, and the Bowery Mission from 1887, until destroyed by fire in 1898.<br><br>

This anchor of the Bowery was, in the 19th Century, a hosiery shop where one clerk stabbed another; then a beer hall where bartender Schaefer was arrested twice for selling beer on Sunday; then a theater whose name changed with the human tide: the National, the Columbia, the Roumanian Opera House, the Teatro Italiano. Here, in 1898, a man murdered another man for strolling with his wife.<br><br>
There were many fires and many owners, including a 260-lb. Tammany functionary named Alderman Fleck, who ran a music hall for <i>dose in de know</i>. When do-gooders failed to close it for acts of immorality, Fleck threw a party that the <i>New York Times</i> said featured scantily clad women &#8220;with capricious thirsts.&#8221;<br><br>
The building served as a moving-picture theater, a rag-sorting business, a penny arcade, and a longtime flophouse offering cheap 4-by-6 cubicles with chicken-wire ceilings. In 1980, George Skoularikos moved into Cubicle No. 40 and stayed long after everyone else had left or died, stalling a new owner’s plan to transform the building into this hotel for Chinese tourists.<br><br>
After court intervention, George finally agreed to leave in exchange for some money and a return to his native Greece in 2005. He died just a few months later, joining Schaefer, Fleck, and so many others in the chorus of ghosts at 104-106 Bowery.<br><br>

You are standing in front of the former site of bridge jumper Steve Brodie’s Saloon. A fast-talking former Five Points street tough turned con man and gambler who had fallen into debt, Brodie took a dare to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge just months after another daredevil perished performing the same stunt.<br><br>
Whether or not he actually made the July 23, 1886 jump (accounts vary), he became an overnight celebrity, opened up the sensationally popular bar, and recreated his bridge jumping feat at the people’s Theatre (199 Bowery) and in theaters across the country. Referenced in novels and depicted in the George Raft film <i>The Bowery</i> and the Bugs Bunny cartoon, <i>Bowery Bugs</i>. Brodie also inspired a long-time saying &#8220;Pulling a Brodie,&#8221; which meant doing a death-defying stunt.<br><br>
In addition to being a museum of the famous stunt, the saloon’s back room was a hangout for sporting men and boxing champs like Tom Sharkey, Terry McGovern and &#8220;Gentleman Jim&#8221; Corbett.<br><br>
Asked by legions of sightseers why he had not attempted the jump again, he always answered, &#8220;I done it oncet.&#8221; Brodie died at around age 36 in 1901.<br><br>

The twin Federal-era houses at 144/136 Bowery are linked to the Underground Railroad and Abolitionist Movement preceding the Civil War. Among the oldest structures in Manhattan, they were built by the Delaplaine family, with 134 built in the 1790s and 136 built to match it in 1828. They retain their steeply pitched roofs and twin gable dormers. A devout Quaker, Samuel Delaplaine’s 1793 manifesto proclaimed:&#8221;…may servitude abolish’d be, As well as Negro-Slavery, To make one LAND of LIBERTY!&#8221;
Reverend Spencer H. Cone, as abolitionist who lived here in the 1820s, was quoted in <i>The Liberator</i>, an influential anti-slavery newspaper: &#8220;I would proclaim liberty throughout the land to all there inhabitants thereof.&#8221;<br>
Booksellers and circulating libraries published and distributed anti-slavery literature in these buildings, which also served as boarding houses and possible fugitive-slave safe houses in the 1830s to the 1860s.<br><br>
In 1872, 134 Bowery became the first of four YMCAs on the Bowery. Partnering with the New York Mission Society, a reading room and the Carmel Chapel were opened, and beds, lodgings and baths were provided to &#8220;all persons, without respect to country, creed, color, sex or age.&#8221;
Famed sculptor Eva Hesse occupied the attic of 134-136 from 1965 until her death in 1970.<br><br>

This monumental Classical Revival bank is one of the first buildings to herald the new classicism popularized by Chicago’s 1893 World Colombian Exposition. Unable to secure the adjacent corner lot on Grand Street, it was designed L-shaped fashion, with ornate entrances on both Streets.<br><br>
The Indiana Limestone and granite bank features a neo-Roman temple frontage on Bowery with massive Corinthian columns and a triumphal arch with deep, coffered barrel vault. The central pediment’s clock is flanked by reclining classical figures and lions. The Grand Street façade has a sculpted pediment raised on Corinthian columns. Pediment sculptures are by Frederick MacMonnies, the Beaux Art sculptor used by White for many of his buildings.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This is the city’s oldest surviving brick townhouse, built in 1785, shortly after the British evacuated New York and before George Washington became President of the new republic. Reflecting the emergence from English colony to new republic, its architecture contains elements of both pre-Revolutionary Georgian and the in-coming Federal style. A well-to-do breeder of racehorses, Edward Mooney was also a wholesale butcher, a trade associated with many of the area’s buildings.<br><br>
In the early 1900s, this was Barney Flynn’s Saloon, hangout of pugilists and base of operations for Chuck Connors, the strutting, self-described &#8220;White Mayor of Chinatown&#8221; whose slumming tours included staged-to-shock visits to roughneck bars and opium dens.<br><br>
It was Connors who got former Bowery newsboy Izzy Baline a singing waiter job at the Pelham Café at 12 Pell Street, where he wrote his first song and changed his name to Irving Berlin. He later wrote &#8220;White Christmas&#8221; and &#8220;God Bless America.&#8221;<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This Beaux Arts style NYC Landmark was built for the Bowery Bank of New York in 1902, replacing the National Butchers (sic) and Drover’s (sic) Bank. Of the approximately 50 bank buildings designed by York & Sawyer, a leading architectural firm, this is the oldest to survive. It simultaneously dominates this busy intersection and complements the monumental facades of the 1894 Bowery Savings Bank by famed architect Stanford White, that flanks it on two sides.<br><br>
By using similar materials and Neo-classic forms, including light-colored stone and a copper crested cornice; (sic) both banks reflect the City Beautiful movement and Beaux Arts style. With most of its classical details, including the &#8220;BB&#8221; initials in the cartouche still visible above street level, today it serves as the city’s only Beaux Arts fruit and vegetable stand!<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[In 1903, this site housed Drammatico Nazionale, one of several Italian theatres established on the Bowery by the great Antonio Maiori. Though Mozart’s librettist Lorenzo DaPonte had staged Italian opera in NYC as early as 1808, and opened a short-lived Italian opera house in 1833, it was through Maiori on the Bowery that Italian theatre was established there.<br><br>
Maiori’s 1902 appearance as Cellini at the Bowery’s Windsor Theatre had made him the darling on NY society’s elite 400, who would travel there in slumming parties to see what Mrs. Havemeyer had proclaimed &#8220;the greatest tragedian in the world.&#8221;
In addition to the Drammatico Nazionale, Maiori established Maiori’s Variety Theatre at 235 Bowery and Maiori’s Royal Theatre at 175-167 Bowery. Actor/producer/director Maiori also co-founded the Italian Actors Union.<br><br>
From 1890 to 1902, this address was home to the Gaiety, one of the Bowery’s most flamboyant dime museums. In addition to trained lions and boxing exhibitions, one could see Jo-Jo the Dog Face Boy, tramp juggler W.C. Fields and contortionist Zamora &#8211; &#8220;the Triple-jointed Wonder&#8221; &#8211; an escape artist who predated Houdini.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Bowery, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Though it has undergone several renovations and name changes over the years, this is believed to be the oldest continuously operating hotel in New York City, welcoming guests since at least 1835.<br><br>
According to the classic book, <i>Old Bowery Days</i>, published in 1931, the building originally housed a tavern known as New Bull’s Head, dating to 1805. Between 1825 and 1830, it was the Bowery House and by 1835, the Military and Civic Hotel. By the 1840s, it was the Westchester House &#8211; described as an &#8220;Old, dingy, yellow painted structure&#8221; in an 1875 memoir &#8211; before taking on the name Occidental Hotel in the mid-1870s.<br><br>
The Occidental’s bar and restaurant was a hotspot for politicians, entertainers and sports figures through the early 20th century, serving boxing champions John. L. Sullivan and James Jackson Jeffries, and political heavyweights like Teddy Roosevelt and Al Smith.<br><br>
On April 3, 1852, the infamous William &#8220;Boss&#8221; Tweed celebrated his birthday here, and from 1900 to 1913, it served as both headquarters and residence to State Senator &#8220;Big&#8221; Tim Sullivan.<br><br>
The Occidental Hotel lost most of its prestige once Tim Sullivan passed away in 1913, and by the time the Great Depression hit in the 1930s, the building hosted cheap lodging under the names Commercial and Pioneer Hotel.<br><br>

Noted architect Ernest Flagg designed the five-story house, which draws inspiration from the English Queen Anne Style, as well as Colonial and Federal styles. Of particular interest are the asymmetrical plan, prominent square cupola, staggered stair windows, pairs of half-fan windows, and a double-height oriel over the garage. The façade was restored in 2000 by the Avi Chai Foundation.<br><br>

The area along and east of the Bowery &#8211; known as <i>Kleindeutchland</i> (Little Germany) was the country’s major German-American center during the second half of the 1800s. The building’s German-born architect, Robert Maynicke. attended Cooper Union, about ten blocks to the north.<br><br>
The building’s most ornate façade element is its verdegris copper crown, which continues to punctuate the historical streetscape. Often visited and photographed for its graffiti-covered exterior, it once housed the studios of artists Roy Lichtenstein and Adolph Gottlieb. In 1966 photographer Jay Maisel purchased the building for $102,000 and used it as his family’s home and studio until 2014 when it was acquired by developer Aby Rosen’s RFR Realty for $55 million.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This is the former site of undertakers McGraw and Taylor, where the body of John Brown was secretly prepared for burial. Executed on December 2, 1859, for the raid on Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, the radical abolitionist had tried to ignite an armed movement to liberate slaves.<br><br>

Brown’s body was transported north in a crude box with the noose still around his neck. After Philadelphia rejected his widow’s attempt to have the remains properly prepared there, the body was shipped to Manhattan, escorted by poet/abolitionist Theodore Tilton. On December 3, it arrived at 163 Bowery under cover of darkness. Quaker undertaker Jacob Hopper prepared the body, assisted by Charley Carpenter, sexton of St. Mark’s Church in the Bowery.<br><br>

When word leaked out, hundreds came out to view the body, including some of the city’s elite. Viewers found it attired in a good suit, resting on ice. One employee said Brown appeared &#8220;as serene as if in sleep,&#8221; and that she had never seen &#8220;a finer looking man of his age, after such a death, too.&#8221;<br><br>
On Dec. 5, in a &#8220;simple but elegant coffin,&#8221; the remains traveled home to Essex County. Before &#8220;moldering in the grave,&#8221; John Brown’s body rested here&#8212;on the Bowery.<br><br>

For nearly 140 years, it has provided food, shelter, clothing, job opportunities, medical assistance and rehabilitation for millions of men. It has run a summer camp for inner city kids since 1894, and homes for women since 1990.<br><br>
Built in 1876 by coffin manufacturer/undertaker Jonas Stolts, 227 Bowery was designed by William Jose. The Chapel’s Tudor-Revival style façade was designed by Marshall and Henry Emery to resemble a welcoming English Inn (sic), with the Prodigal Son story depicted in stained-glass windows designed by Tiffany protégé Benjamin Sellers. It became a NYC Landmark in 2012.<br><br>
The Mission expanded into the circa 1830 Federal-style townhouse at 229 Bowery in 1980. From 1879 to 1893, it was the studio of photographer Charles Eisenmann, for his portraits of exotic sideshow performers.<br><br>

The most famous of his houses was Miner’s Bowery Theatre (est. 1878). It was here that his son Tom instituted the famous amateur night and its famous innovation &#8220;the hook&#8221;, a large shepherd’s crook used for yanking unpopular acts off the stage&#8212;often at the audience’s urging: &#8220;Get the hook!&#8221; The device was widely emulated throughout the country, and has even become an idiom in the English language.

While modern sensibilities dismiss exhibitions of physical difference as exploitative, paradoxically these performers often commanded the highest salaries, some becoming rich and famous.

Photography studios proliferated on the Bowery during Eisenmann’s day, and in the last 75 years the street has provided home, studio and/or inspiration to scores of photographers such as Robert Frank, Weegee, Jay Maisel, Nan Goldin and Stephanie Chernikowski.<br><br>

It served as the home of Bell Telephone Labs (1898 to 1966) where many technological innovations were developed or advanced, including radar, television and video telephones. It re-opened in 1970 as Westbeth, an early example of large-scale adaptive re-use of an industrial building. One of the first projects developed in collaboration with the J.M. Kaplan Fund, it continues to provide affordable live-work space to nearly four hundred artists and their families.

    <desc><![CDATA[The New Museum is the former site of the London Theatre, where in 1894 Lotte Gilson (&#8220;The Little Magnet&#8221;) first sang &#8220;The Sidewalks of New York,&#8221; an iconic song that encapsulated the feel of Manhattan’s working class neighborhoods.<br><br>
The London Theatre opened 27 November, 1876. Performers whose careers were set on the paths to success here include Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, W.C. Fields and comic duo Weber and Fields. Responding to changing demographics, the London later became a Yiddish theatre, a Chinese theatre, and an Italian opera house.<br><br>
The Bowery’s musical connections also include American musical theatre pioneers Harrigan and Hart; songwriter Irving Berlin (&#8220;White Christmas&#8221;), who worked the area as newsboy and singing waiter; and songwriter Stephen Foster ("Beautiful Dreamer&#8221;), who lived, wrote and died on the Bowery.<br><br>
Many German classical works, like Wagner’s Tannhauser, had their American premieres at Bowery Theaters. In addition to punk rock’s birth at CBGB in the 1970s, the 20th century also saw folk singer Woody Guthrie playing Bowery bars during his first weeks in NYC as he wrote &#8220;This Land Is Your Land.&#8221; The Bowery itself inspired scores of songs, including the sardonic &#8220;The Bowery,&#8221; a song some feel hastened the street’s decline.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[A designated New York City landmark, this Queen Anne-style building opened on October 15, 1885 as the Young Men’s Institute, a branch of the YMCA. Featuring a gymnasium, bowling alley, library, entertainment hall, and rooftop garden, the Institute was created, in the words of the New-York Daily Tribune, &#8220;as an offset to the cheap amusement resorts&#8221; then proliferating along the Bowery. While YMCA missions at 134, 153 and 243 Bowery did rescue work, the Institute stressed prevention, with vocational classes and a lecture series that featured Teddy Roosevelt and Henry Ward Beecher.<br><br>
Vacated by the YMCA during the early 1930s, the structure began attracting painters such as Fernand Leger, who used one of its loft spaces as a studio. From 1958 to 1959, Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko painted the murals originally intended for Midtown’s Seagram Building here. Other residents have included poet John Giorno, visual artists Michael Goldberg and Lynn Umlauf, as well as Beat Generation writer William Burroughs, who famously dubbed his apartment, &#8220;the Bunker.&#8221;<br><br>

Frank’s films include the Beat Generation classic <i>Pull My Daisy (1959)</i> and the notorious Rolling Stones documentary <i>Cocksucker Blues</i> (1972). Later, Frank expanded into photomontage and music video work.<br><br>
An 1887 Renaissance Revival style structure designed by William Graul as a commercial space, 184 Bowery became the Lincoln Hotel in 1924, the name of which is repeated on each step of the building’s first flight of stairs. Converted to artist lofts in 1969, it was provided a nurturing space for photographers Paco Grande and Daniel Seymour, actress Jessica Lange, musician John Campo, and artist June Leaf.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[In 1892, anarchist leader Emma Goldman led a meeting at Military Hall in defense of her lover/comrade, Alexander Berkman, jailed after a botched attempt to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick, villain of the bloody Homestead Steel Strike. A focal point for agitation on many fronts, it was Military Hall at which, after fierce debate in 1853, officers of the 8-year-old Municipal Police agreed to wear an official uniform.<br><br>
Shortly after opening, in 1829 it hosted the first North American service of the evangelical primitive Methodists. In 1835, the venerable St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church held its first worship service here. A humorous April 1867 NY Clipper article described that with windows open Methodist hymns competed with racy minstrel songs bellowing from the nearby Tony Pastor’s Opera House.<br><br>
In 1868, Military Hall also witnessed the formation of the Elks Lodge, aka the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, then know as the &#8220;Jolly Corks.&#8221; It remained a locus for the diverse movements fertilizing Bowery life throughout the 19th century. The building’s current façade was added to the original structure in the 1920s.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[You are standing at the former site of People’s Theatre, one of a dozen Bowery theatres that comprised the Yiddish theatre’s first American home. In its heyday (1880-1914), thousands of Jewish immigrants came here to escape poverty, tedium and despair and immerse themselves in the comedy, tragedy and spectacle unfolding onstage.<br><br>
By 1891, playwright Jacob Gordin had shifted Yiddish Theatre from trashy entertainments into original literary dramas and adaptions of classics including works by Ibsen, Tolstoy and Shakespeare featuring superstars Jacob Adler and Boris Thomashefsky. Adler moved audiences to sobs and cheers with interpretations of Shylock and Lear. Thomashefsky’s Hamlet brought audiences to their feet with calls of &#8220;Author! Author!&#8221; to which he pleaded forgiveness since &#8220;Shekspir lives far away in England and could not come.&#8221;<br><br>
After WWI, Yiddish theatre’s base moved from Bowery to Second Avenue between Houston and 14th Street &#8211; a stretch celebrated until the 1940s as the &#8220;Yiddish Rialto.&#8221;<br><br>

Known as the &#8220;Bowery Autocrat,&#8221; Antonio Pastor (1832-1908), was born in NYC, sang as a child performer in P.T. Barnum’s Museum, and worked for a time as a circus ringmaster and blackface minstrel. After the Civil War, he launched his Opera House (1865-1875) where he sang, reigned as master of ceremonies and booked the acts, including Harrigan and Hart, the fathers of American musical comedy.<br><br>
Unlike the raucous variety shows in saloons, Pastor’s shows opened with the &#8220;Star Spangled Banner,&#8221; and were intentionally made clean and suitable for women and children. Drinking, smoking and rude language were banned, and this is one of the ways Pastor can be said to have invented vaudeville, although he never used the word himself.]]></desc>

Its walls are one-foot thick and laid with Flemish-bond brickwork over a stone foundation.<br><br>
In the early 19th Century, many residents, especially butchers, moved from lower Manhattan to this portion of the Bowery, which was being improved by digging out the roadbed, laying sidewalk stones and installing gaslights. John Brown and his wife, Lydia, lived here and operated John Brown’s Porterhouse, a tavern serving area butchers in the adjoining 208 Bowery, which before alterations looked very much like its intact neighbor. 208 later became the popular Wood’s Photography Studio, which attracted sharpshooter legend Annie Oakley.<br><br>

Joseph (Giuseppe) Petrosino (1860-1909) was the first Italian-American lieutenant and detective in the New York City Police Department. Petrosino formed the &#8220;Italian Branch&#8221;, an elite corps of Italian-American undercover police that combated the &#8220;Black Hand&#8221; (Mano Nego) crime organization in America and Italy. As a result, thousands of organized crime figures were arrested. He also founded the bomb and canine squads, the first units of their kind in the United States.<br><br>
Petrosino was killed in Palermo, making him the only New York City police officer to lose his life in the line of duty outside the United States. Upon his death, President Theodore Roosevelt declared, &#8220;Petrosino was a great man and a good man … he did not know the name of fear.&#8221; Many thousands of mourners attended his state funeral.<br><br>
Joseph Petrosino remains a symbol of justice and social responsibility. The Lieutenant Detective Joseph Petrosino Awards are presented to outstanding police officers and other distinguished individuals in law enforcement.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Kenmare Street, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This small park is at the crossroads of several dynamic New York neighborhoods: Little Italy and the Bowery to the east, Chinatown to the south, and SoHo to the west and north. The site/area became parkland as a result of the City Charter of 1938, which turned over all public places and squares to the Department of Parks.<br><br>
The site was formerly known as Kenmare Square, for the street that runs east to Delancy. Around the turn of the century, Tammany Hall leader &#8220;Big Tim&#8221; Sullivan of the Lower East Side names Kenmare Street in honor of his mother’s birthplace, a village in County Kerry, Ireland. Kenmare Square was renamed in honor of Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino (1860-1909) by a local law, introduced by Council Member Miriam Freelander, passed by the City Council, and signed by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1987.<br><br>
Giuseppe (Joseph) Petrosino was born in Salerno, Italy, and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1873. As a boy, he shined shoes outside Police Headquarters on Mulberry Street. At the age of eighteen, he began his career in public service with the Department of Sanitation (then under the jurisdiction of the Police Department). Fluent in many Italian dialects, Petrosino aided the police by working undercover as an informer in Little Italy.<br><br>
When he joined the Police Department in 1883, Petrosino was the city’s shortest officer, at five feet and three inches tall. Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt personally promoted him to Sergeant of Detectives in 1895. While investigating anarchists in the United States, Petrosino warned President McKinley of threats against his life; however, the warning was not heeded and the President was assassinated in 1901.<br><br>
Within ten years, Petrosino was named Lieutenant and given command of the new Italian Squad, a unit created to combat the crime organization known as the Black Hand. Under his leadership, several thousand arrests were made, and more than 500 offenders were sent to prison. Crimes against Italian-Americans dropped by nearly fifty percent. Petrosino was killed while on assignment to Salerno, Italy.<br><br>
When his body was returned to New York, thousands of mourners formed a funeral procession which marched from Little Italy to Cavalry Cemetery in Queens. Lt. Petrosino was the only New York police officer who had died in the line of duty outside the United States. The park named in his honor is located just north of the Renaissance Revival edifice at 240 Centre Street, which served as Police Headquarters from 1910 to 1971.<br><br>

Master at swaying public opinion and votes for the Democratic machine, he utilized street gangs for voter fraud and intimidation. Serving as NY State Senator and U.S. Congressman, he enriched himself through real estate, theatres, gambling and prostitution.<br><br>
Even in high-powered positions, he kept close to his working-poor roots and is credited with bringing under-represented groups &#8211; like Jews and Italians &#8211; into one of America’s first multi-ethnic organizations. he gave out shoes to the needy, and every Christmas, hundreds of men lined up around the block here, for live entertainment, free beer, and hot meals &#8211; served by the Senator himself. On his summer boat excursions, men ate and drank until morning.<br><br>
While vice was never more rampant than during Sullivan’s reign, he nonetheless supported measures for women and labor, and helped enact the Sullivan Law, which outlawed concealed weapons without a permit.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Carved from sandstone quarried in Ohio, this impressive Italian Renaissance façade boasts a sophisticated hierarchy of window ornament in the three upper stories, graduating from pealed pediments, to round pediments to flat lintels with projecting stone blocks, called quoins, defining the building’s corners. Unfortunately, completion of the New Amsterdam Savings Bank in 1872 was followed by the financial Panic of 1873. The bank, headed by a board of German immigrants, failed by 1876 during a wave of bank failures following the panic and ensuing depression. In 1878 the building was taken over by Germania Bank until it moved in 1898 to its newly-built headquarters at 190 Bowery.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[By 1890, it was estimated that 9,000 homeless men, many of them alcoholics or gambling addicts, found lodging in Bowery flophouses. Accommodations could be a person-sized spot to flop on a wooden floor in a large open ward for 5 cents or a wooden cubicle about four feet by seven for 15 cents.<br><br>
Nathaniel H. Lyons founded the Lyons Hotel Co. which came to own at least twenty lodging houses including the purpose-built Alabama Hotel constructed in 1889. The architect was James E. Ware (1846-1918), most noteworthy for developing the dumbbell plan, a housing reform design that slightly improved upon the light and air reaching interior rooms of tenement apartments.<br><br>
The eclectic style of the brick and stone façade displays both Renaissance Revival and Queen Anne features, including central projecting bays with decorative panels and pilasters at the second and third stories and the fifth floor arcade. A lodging house for 77 years, the upper stories were converted to artist’s lofts in 1966.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[These buildings once housed the legendary nightclub, Sammy’s Bowery Follies &#8211; &#8220;The place where the high life meets the low life.&#8221; Made famous by photographers Weegee, Erika Stone, Burt Glinn, Lisette Model and Alfred Eisenstadt, it was known for its raucous parties, zany variety shows and as the place where politicians and celebrities rubbed elbows with &#8220;Bowery Bums&#8221; and busloads of tourists. Life magazine said prosperous uptowners came to see &#8220;how the other half staggers.&#8221;<br><br>
In 1934, Sammy Fuchs took over a grungy dive saloon that had once housed McGurk’s Mug, hired former vaudeville performers, incorporated a &#8220;Gay 90s&#8221; theme and rebranded it the &#8220;Stork Club of the Bowery.&#8221; Sammy’s singing waiters, playful show tunes, sing-a-longs and comedy skits attracted patrons from all over the globe seeking an &#8220;authentic&#8221; Bowery experience included Albert Camus, Rosalind Russell, Edward G. Robinson, Harold Lloyd, Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante and Mae West.<br><br>
To ensure guests were not disappointed, Sammy hired the most outrageous acts he could find and supplied Bowery drunks free booze to heighten the frantic atmosphere. He passed away in 1969, and Sammy’s closed its doors on September 29, 1970, after a three-decade run as one of the most heavily-visited attractions in the city.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[By the early 1880s this Italianate style building had become the Great Northern Hotel, where in 1884, 18 year-old Frank Samsel, a brush maker from Bohemia, Germany killed himself with a pistol in Room No. 38. In the early 20th century, as Windsor Lodging House, with a capacity of 200 beds at 20 cents a bed, it also became a notorious thieves den. However, it was also home to Emil Brunner, known to his acquaintances and fellow-lodgers as the &#8220;honestest man in the Bowery.&#8221; Although only earning 50 cents a day as a cleaner, Brunner found and returned a pocketbook containing $47 and refused a reward.<br><br>
Most unusual for this area, the Dorchester Stone façade, a yellowish sandstone, was quarried in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, Canada. It retains many of the original 1871 Italianate features, such as its window hoods, brackets, cornice and cast iron fire escapes.<br><br>
 In the 1870s, it was part of a large factory, office and salesroom complex of buildings for cigar manufacturer, Lichtenstein Bros. & Co. that fronted on Bowery, Houston and Elizabeth Streets.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[The Bowery &#8211; its broad, crooked arc first traversed on foot by Native Americans over unknown centuries &#8211; remains New York City’s oldest thoroughfare and one of the world’s few streets whose name evokes meaning beyond a mere place on a map. Stretching 1.25 miles from Chatham Square to Cooper Square, 400 years of Euro-American history make the Bowery undisputedly the city’s most architecturally diverse & historically significant streetscape, with building representing every decade since 1780.<br><br>
Colonial Dutch <i>bouwerij</i> (farm) road; Manhattan’s first Free Black settlement; George Washington’s Revolution-era procession route; epicenter of 19th Century Irish-American political influence as well as German-American culture; the Bowery was also the site of Lincoln’s famous anti-slavery speech. New York’s first entertainment district, since the early 1800s, the Bowery has incubated uniquely American cultural expressions, including tap dance, minstrelsy, vaudeville, jazz, Abstract Expressionism, Beat literature, and punk rock.<br><br>
The Bowery was a 19th century stomping ground for the working class, the Bowery Boys gang, gay New Yorkers and waves of Irish, Italian, Chinese, German and Jewish immigrants. Since the 20th century, it has served as a jewelry, lighting, and restaurant supply district; a base for the homeless, and a live/work space for an influential community of cutting edge artists.<br><br>
While the shiny, generic condos of recent overdevelopment consume rare & significant sites along the fabled thoroughfare, the Bowery’s importance was recognized with listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Despite this honor and widely supported calls for preservation, this richly layered repository of social, economic, political, cultural and architectural history remains one of the country’s most endangered historic places.<br><br>

Not so long ago, New Yorkers travelling overseas left from passenger terminals located on Manhattan’s west side piers. Steamship lines owned their own terminals, and the arrivals and departures of great ships were occasions for celebration. Although passenger ship traffic through the Port of New York has dwindled to a trickle since its heyday, the city’s waters still play host to a colorful parade of vessels, from stately tall ships to powerful tugboats towing strings of barges laden with everything from gasoline to garbage. Ferries ply back and forth between Manhattan and Liberty, Ellis and Staten Island; Circle Line excursion boats carry cargos of sight-seeing tourists and gleaming cruise liners come and go with staterooms full of vacationers; and fleets of sleek pleasure craft take to the water in warm weather.<br><br>
<i>Right:</i><br> Along the Western Shore<br>
Once a gritty, industrial landscape, New Jersey’s Hudson River shoreline has been transformed in recent years. The development of Liberty State Park in Jersey City (home to the Liberty Science Center, directly across from Battery Park City) and several new high-rise office towers has dramatically reshaped the skyline. Most of the new buildings are office complexes, giving the region a corporate character. Others are residential developments with breath-taking views of Manhattan. One lingering legacy of the area’s manufacturing past is the enormous Colgate clock, 50 ft. in diameter with its minute hand alone weighing 2,200 lbs. The clock is all that remains of a once-bustling plant, but long-time New Yorkers still recall the smell of soap wafting across the river.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>A Field Guide of New York Harbor<br></b>
New York Harbor extends from its dramatic gateway at The Narrows, a turbulent channel separating Staten Island from Brooklyn, to the Battery at Manhattan’s southern-most tip. One of the world’s great natural harbors, Upper New York Bay has welcomed a steady stream of ships since the 17th Century. During the 19th century, thousands of immigrants marked the end of their passage to America with the sight of the Statue of Liberty and arrival at Ellis Island. According to the logs of explorer Giovanni da Verrazano (sic), the harbor offered &#8220; a very agreeable situation located within two prominent hills, in the midst of which flowed to the sea a very great river…&#8221; These are a few of its more prominent landmarks.<br><br><b>
The Age of Sail<br></b>
Only a century ago New York Harbor was crowded with sails. Vessels of every description criss-crossed the waters where two rivers meet, battling tricky tides and currents and seeking favorable winds. Coastal packets carried passengers and freight to nearby destinations in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Great schooners came and went, linking the city to overseas ports. For the first 200 years of its existence, the City’s livelihood depended on the waterfront. All along the lower Manhattan shoreline, ships jostled for position at the busy piers where their cargos were loaded and unloaded. The island at its edges sometimes seemed forested with masts.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On West 28th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Bayard Rustin was an essential figure in the
U.S. Civil Rights Movement who shaped many of
the core principles, strategies, and defining events.<p>

Beginning in the 1940s, Rustin spearheaded
efforts to dismantle racial discrimination and
segregation laws in the U.S. using Gandhian
nonviolent methods. Convinced that these tactics
could transform struggles for black American
liberation and equality. Rustin organized and led
civil disobedience actions across the country,
including many of the first freedom rides and
sit-ins. These pioneering acts would become the
blueprints for major racial justice campaigns
that advanced groundbreaking legislation and
roused the national consciousness.<p> 

 When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. first emerged
as a leader during the Montgomery Bus Boycott
of 1955-56, Rustin introduced King to the 
foundations of nonviolent direct action. Rustin
became a trusted mentor and advisor to King,
and served the growing movement from behind
the scenes as a strategist, writer, founder of key
coalitions, and architect of major mobilizations.<p>

In 1963, facing violent backlash and seeking a
political breakthrough, movement leaders called
for the March on Washington for Jobs and
Freedom, and chose Rustin to be its chief
organizer. Masterfully planned and orchestrated,
it was the largest demonstration in the nation’s
history, and was instrumental in galvanizing
support for landmark federal civil rights laws.<p>

The era and its legacy are imbued with Rustin’s
vision. With his influence, nonviolent resistance
became the moral and strategic cornerstone of 
the Civil Rights Movement.<p>

Throughout his rich and varied life, Rustin lent
his talents and expertise to a diverse array of
social causes ranging from global peace to
economic justice, often alongside his mentor,
civil rights and labor leader A. Philip Randolph. <p>

Rustin was an openly and unapologetically gay
black man in an era of intense discrimination.
It took decades for Rustin to be recognized for
his central roles in numerous fights for equality
and human dignity.<p>]]></desc>

The chapels proved so unexpectedly popular with landlubbers that seats had to be reserved for the seafarers, testifying to New Yorkers’ love of novelty.<br><br>
Though the floating chapels are long gone, the Institute has locations throughout the U.S. and serves sailors all over the world. Once operating at 241 Water Street, it has moved its headquarters to 50 Broadway. Its enormous collection of historic items, once on display at its former Water Street location, has been moved to Queens College. Today, 241 Water Street is occupied by the Blue School.]]></desc>

South Street Seaport recently lost its famously pungent neighbor, New York’s Fulton Fish Market. Founded in the early 19th century, the market occupied a ramshackle collection of buildings that came to life in the earliest hours of the morning. Some 180 years of fishmongering on these streets finally ended on November 14th, 2005, as the market &#8211; largest of its kind in the country &#8211; moved to 400,000 square feet of modern facilities in Hunts Point in the Bronx.<br><br>
Pier 17<br>
Pier 17 stretches out into the East River, a three story class and steel pavilion forming part of the Rouse Company’s original plans for the South Street Seaport. General Growth Properties, which acquired the Seaport in 2004, is planning new residential and retail development, including restaurants, hotels and a community center- as well as expanded open space and water vistas. The rambling 1907 Tin Building from fish market days will be preserved and relocated to the end of the Pier, perched at the water’s edge. In nice weather, visitors can climb the Pier’s outside staircases to the upper level, stretch out on a deck chair and feel like they’ve landed a berth on an ocean liner &#8211; enjoying Downtown’s famous silhouette views of the bridges up river, the Brooklyn port down river, and Brooklyn Heights beckoning on the opposite shore.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Back in the era before radio, television or the Internet, when the newspaper was the principal medium of communication, the tall buildings along Park Row formed &#8220;newspaper row,&#8221; the great district of the city’s &#8211; and the nation’s &#8211; newspaper trade. Here, Joseph Pulitzer presided over <i>The World</i> in the gilded dome of the Pulitzer Building, hoping to scoop his neighbors, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Tribune</i> and the <i>Sun</i>. Convenient to both Wall Street and City Hall, they printed the stories of business and politics. On nearby streets the <i>Evening Journal</i>, the <i>Evening Post</i>, the <i>Herald</i>, and the <i>Mail and Express</i> competed &#8211; back when New York supported some 20 English-language daily papers, not to mention the weeklies, and countless foreign-language sheets. The very sidewalks vibrated from the constant thundering of the presses.<br><br>
By the turn of the century however, as businesses began to move uptown, the papers began to follow. The <i>Herald</i> moved to Sixth Avenue and 34th Street (which became Herald Square), <i>The Times</i> to Broadway and 42nd Street (Times Square), and by the 1930s newspaper row was empty. of the buildings originally housing the big dailies, only the tall, gray stone Times tower at 41 Park Row survives.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Right: Archaeological Discovery<br>
While excavating to build Imagination Playground, archeologists uncovered buried wharfs. Codswise’s Wharf, along John Street, was built between 1803 and 1807 by George Codwise Jr., a prominent New York merchant. Remsen’s Wharf, at Burling Slip and Front Street, was built about ten years earlier.<br>
What is a Wharf?<br>
A wharf is a structure that extends from the shore into a harbor to serve as a docking place for ships. The wharfs on this site was built of pine and hemlock timbers from the Hudson Valley, which were stacked horizontally and notched together like the walls of a log house.<br><br>
Left: Making Land<br>
As the leading port in New York City, the South Street Seaport was an international center of commerce by the mid-19th century. Making land along the waterfront was common in New York City from the earliest settlement through recent times. Approximately one third of Manhattan’s current landmass south of City Hall is comprised of artificially made land.<br>
Wharfing Out<br>
Slips provided a place for ships to dock between wharfs. Over time, slips were extended into the river. Most of the made land in the city was built through this progressive process of &#8220;wharfing out.&#8221;<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>In addition to its maritime history, the area surrounding <i>Peck Slip</i> boasts many New York landmarks. Opened in 1812 just to the south, <i>Fulton Fish Market</i> (1) is one of the last working areas on the waterfront and the largest of its kind in the U.S.<br><br>
<i>Meyers Hotel</i>, (2) built in the late 19th century, is now a bar but it retains the feel of days gone by when renowned markswoman Annie Oakley stayed there.<br><br>
Across the river, to the right of the Brooklyn landing, the residential area of Brooklyn Heights is prominent. In 1965, this picturesque neighborhood was registered as the first historic district on New York City.<br><br>
The <i>FDR Drive</i> runs overhead. It was constructed using landfill from blitzed World War II London, transported here on U.S. ships as ballast.<br><br>
Immediately south is the <i>South Sea Seaport</i>. Once the center of New York’s port district, it has been restored as a working museum, including <i>Schermerhorn Row</i>, (3) an original early 19th century façade with picturesque shops and the <i>Titanic Memorial Lighthouse</i>, (4) on Fulton Street between Pearl and Water Streets, which features a highly original clock. <i>Pier 17</i>, behind Fulton Fish Market is one of the remaining piers here, and provides a recreational area and access to two historical ships permanently moored at <i>pier (sic) 16</i>.<br><br>
Amongst the modern skyscrapers visible inland is the grand <i>Municipal Building</i> (5) which impressed Stalin so much that the University of Moscow was modeled on its design.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[This reach of the East River, from here to <i>Rutgers Slip</i> (1) is rich in maritime history. Peck Slip was one of the last and most important of New York harbor’s slips. The burgeoning population of European immigrants reclaimed new land from the East River to expand their thriving harbor community in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The shoreline was extended east from <i> Pearl Street</i>.<br><br>
The Dutch were the first settlers in this waterfront district. Later Irish, German and English immigrants worked in the maritime industry that dominated this area - <i>shipyards, ironworks, </i>(2) docks and ferries. These would be found along the shoreline and the nearby slips and piers.<br><br>
More recently, many Italians and European Jews also settled on the &#8220;Lower East Side&#8221;, creating one of the first &#8220;melting pot&#8221; communities in the city.<br><br>
<i>Walton House</i> (3) was built in 1752 at 326-328 Pearl Street, next to Peck Slip, by William Walton. For 30 years it was New York’s most handsome residence and his lavish entertainment prior to the revolution encouraged the British government to raise taxes.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 10th Avenue, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Scholar and poet Clement Clarke Moore (1779-1863) is the namesake
of two New York City parks. The
first is a playground in Elmhurst,
Queens, known as the Clement Clarke
Moore Homestead. The second is
this playground, located on a former
farmstead purchased by Clement's
grandfather, Captain Thomas Clarke,
in 1750. A retired British Army officer,
Captain Clarke named his property
"Chelsea&#8221; after London's Royal
Chelsea Hospital for veterans. His
daughter and son-in-law extended
the boundaries to what are now
19th Street, Eighth Avenue, 24th
Street, and the Hudson River.<p>

Born in New York City, Clement Clarke
Moore spent most of his life on the
Chelsea estate. He graduated from
Columbia College with a B.A. in 1798,
an M.A. in 1801, and an honorary
LL.D. in 1829. Moore donated land
for the nearby General Theological
Seminary, where he taught Oriental
and Greek literature from 1823 until
his retirement in 1850. Fluent in six
languages, he published numerous
scholarly works, including a Hebrew
lexicon, a biography, and several
treatises and addresses.<p>

Moore is best known for having
penned the delightful children's
poem, "A Visit from St. Nicholas."<p>

He composed the poem for his wife
Catherine and their children in 1822.
A family friend had the poem published
anonymously in the Troy Sentinel the
following year. The poem soon became
a classic, popularly known as "The
Night before Christmas.&#8221; Moore died
in Newport, Rhode Island in 1863.<p>

Ninety-nine years later, the West 400
Block Association 23-22-21 initiated the
improvement of neglected property at
the corner of Tenth Avenue and 22nd
Street. The City of New York acquired
the site in 1965 for use as a public park.
The playground opened on November
22, 1968 and was named for Clement
Clarke Moore by local law in 1969.<p>

Renovations to Clement Clarke Moore
Park in 1995 included a new perimeter
fence, modular play equipment,
safety surfacing, pavements, and
transplanted trees. Community
members plant and maintain the
flower beds, and the West 400
Block Association holds a variety
of special events at the park. Every
Christmas time, residents gather to
read the poem that begins with the
familiar words:<p>
Twas the night before Christmas,<br>
when all through the house<br>
Not a creature was stirring,<br>
not even a mouse.<br>]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Hudson Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[As its faded inscription reads, this
sculpture was "erected by popular
subscription in honor of the brave men
who went forth from this neighborhood
to join the Armed Forces of the United
States during the World War.&#8221; The
dramatic bronze statue on a granite
pedestal, dedicated in 1921, is by Philip
Martiny (1858-1927), and depicts a foot
soldier in battle (known commonly in
World War I as a "doughboy"), pistol in
one hand, the other holding a swirling
American flag.<p>

The derivation of the term doughboy
remains in question. It was first used
by the British in the late 18th and early
19th centuries to describe soldiers
and sailors. In the United States the
nickname was coined during the
Mexican-American War (1846-1848),
and was widely popularized during
World War I (1914-1918) to refer to
infantrymen. After the war, in which
Americans saw combat in 1917-18,
numerous communities commissioned
doughboy statues to honor the local war
heroes. The Abingdon Square Doughboy
is one of eight such statues erected in
New York City's parks.<p>

The monument was a gift of the
Jefferson Democratic Club, whose
headquarters once stood opposite this
statue north of the park on the site
now occupied by the residential high
rise at 299 West 12th Street. Philip
Martiny was a well-known sculptor
of his day who received numerous
public commissions, among them the
statues on the Surrogate Courthouse
in Lower Manhattan, and the Chelsea
Doughboy at 28th Street and 9th
Avenue (for which the same model
posed). The unveiling of the statue is
reported to have been attended by
10,000 spectators, including 200 Gold
Star Mothers (those who lost their
sons in battle), and New York Governor
Alfred E. Smith. In 1993, the statue was
cleaned of soiling and surface corrosion,
repatined, and waxed by the NYC Parks
monuments unit, and since 1996 has
been cared for by NYC Parks' Citywide
Monuments Conservation Program,
supported in part by the Abingdon
Square Conservancy and contributions
from individual donors.<p>

In 2004, during the redesign and
renovation of the park, the monument
was relocated to face the southern
entryway, improving its visibility and
illumination. It remains a focal point
of Abingdon Square and a symbol of
sacrifice and community pride.]]></desc>

9 medallion segments, each with an area map, descriptive text, and a laser-engraved illustration.<br>
1) 1625 to 1664: Founding and Settlement<br>
Since New York’s founding in 1625 as the Dutch trading colony New Amsterdam, the land now occupied by City Hall Park has played a central role in the civic life of our city. It has been used as a pasture, a parade ground, a place for public executions, the site of an almshouse, a prison, a and a public gathering place in times of conflict and celebration. From 1653 to 1699, when the first City Hall was located in a converted tavern on Pearl Street, this land was well north of city limits and used as a communal pasture ground for livestock. It was known as the Commons. A deep, spring-fed pond, known as the Collect, served as the northeast boundary for the Commons. its western boundary, along the modern day Broadway, followed the path of a Native American trail. In 1663, a windmill became the first recorded structure on the Commons. In 1664, New Amsterdam was captured from the Dutch by British forces and renamed New York. The City Seal was adopted later that year.<br>
2) 1665 to 1775: Under British Rule<br>
New York City was already a vibrant center of commerce and culture, and its population nearly doubled between 1690 and 1723, growing from 3,900 to 7,200. In 1736, a publicly financed Almshouse was built on the present site of City Hall to house ill and impoverished residents. It was part infirmary, part jail and part workhouse &#8211; both orphans and adults were taught skills that would help them gain employment. In 1757, construction of a debtors’ prison known as &#8220; the New Gaol&#8221;, began east of the present City Hall, and Soldiers’ barracks were built on the north end of the Commons, where the Tweed Courthouse now stands. The Commons was the site of many pre-Revolutionary protests and celebrations. When the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765, outraged New Yorkers protested on the Commons &#8211; and when the Act was repealed, citizens celebrated on the Commons. However, dissatisfaction with British rule continued to grow and, beginning in 1766, a group of New Yorkers known as the Sons of Liberty erected a Liberty Pole outside the Soldiers’ Barracks. The Liberty Pole was chopped down by British troops and replaced five times. A replica of the pole now stands between City Hall and Broadway, near its original location.<br>
3) 1776 to 1799: Revolution and Independence<br>
On July 9, 1776, New Yorkers gathered on the Commons to hear the Declaration of Independence read aloud in the presence of General George Washington and soldiers of the Continental Army. Two months later, New York City was captured and became British Army Headquarters in America throughout the Revolution. During the occupation, American soldiers were kept in the New Gaol and in a new prison called the Bridewell. The British officer in charge of the prisons in New York City, Provost Marshall William Cunningham, later confessed to starving 2,000 prisoners to death and stealing their rations, as well as ordering the execution of more than 250 Continental soldiers on gallows located behind the Soldiers’ Barracks. Therefore, City Hall Park is the site of what is believed to be one of the first mass executions of American prisoners of war in our nation’s history. On November 25, 1783, the British evacuated New York, and Washington led the victorious Continental Army into the City where the American flag was raised in celebration over the Commons. Over the next seven years, new York City served as the first capital of the United States, home of the first United States Congress, and birthplace of the Bill of Rights. On April 30, 1789, George Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street. After his inauguration, President Washington prayed at St, Paul’s Chapel, which still stands to the south of City Hall Park.<br>
4) 1800 to 1835: City Hall<br>
The first calls to turn the Commons into a public park came at the turn of the century. One contemporary newspaper wrote, &#8220;This place, laid out with judgement and taste, would be a blessing to the inhabitants of New York and an ornament to the City.&#8221; In 1802, the City government announced a contest to design a new City Hall. Architects John McComb Jr. and Joseph Mangin won the competition, and its prize of $350. The cornerstone was laid in 1803, and in 1812, the building was opened to the public. City Hall was set back in a gated park, and its marble exterior and prominent dome were designed to be seen clearly from the steps of St. Paul’s Chapel and the sidewalks of lower Broadway. At the time, some citizens criticized the choice of location as being too far north of the City’s center. As New York grew, development in and around City Hall increased as well. In 1818, a circular building known as the Rotunda was built on the Park’s northeast corner to house the City’s first art museum, and a dozen years later, the New Gaol was converted to the City hall of Records. When torn down in 1903, it was the oldest municipal building in New York. On Independence Day, 1827, the remaining enslaved people in New York City and State were freed, four decades before slavery was abolished throughout the nation. Two days of celebrations followed, including a parade that stopped in City Hall Park.<br>
5) 1836 to 1869: Progress, Prosperity and Civil War<br>
In 1836, New York City’s first luxury hotel, the five-story Astor House opened on Broadway overlooking City Hall Park. In 1842, the Croton Fountain was built on the southern tip of the Park to celebrate the opening of the Croton Aqueduct, which provided New York City’s first dependable supply of pure water. The Aqueduct drew water from the Croton Dam, more than 10 miles north of the city, and was considered one of the great engineering feats of the 19th Century. The fountain was fed directly by the aqueduct and shot a spire of water fifty feet into the air. In August 1858, during celebrations commemorating the first transatlantic telegraph cable, fireworks started a fire on the dome of City Hall. During the Civil War a number of temporary buildings were erected in City Hall Park, including barracks and recruiting tents. Weeks after the of the war in April 1865, City Hall was draped in black cloth as President Abraham Lincoln’s body lay in state at the top of the rotunda staircase. Over the course of two days, thousands of New Yorkers paid their respects, and 60,000 followed the memorial procession from City Hall Park.<br> 
6) 1870 to 1897: The Federal Post Office<br>
In 1870, the triangular shape of was altered when an ornate Federal Post Office was built on the southern tip of the park. When construction of the Post Office began, New Yorker George Templeton String wrote in his diary &#8220;This will destroy the best known and most characteristic street in New York … looking up from Fulton Street and Broadway across the Park to the south front of old City Hall.&#8221; The construction of the Post Office resulted in the removal of the Croton Fountain and the wrought iron fence around City Hall Park. An elaborate granite fountain designed by noted park architect Jacob Wrey Mould was installed closer to City Hall and became the centerpiece of the Park. In 1880, New York became the first City (sic) in the nation with a population that surpassed one million. In 1881, work was complete on the Tweed Courthouse, which still stands north of City Hall. In 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was opened. In October 1886, the first ticker-tape parade was spontaneously held on Broadway to celebrate the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, beginning a tradition that has honored pioneers of aviation and space exploration, political and wartime leaders, and New York City’s champion sports teams. <br>
7) 1898 to 1938: Expansion<br>
On the evening of December 31, 1897, citizens gathered in City Hall Park to celebrate the consolidation of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, the Bronx and Manhattan into the City of Greater New York. Overnight, the City expanded from 24 square miles to more than 300 and the population grew from 1.8 million to 3.4 million. In 1903, the construction of the original City Hall subway station was completed &#8211; the first segment of what would become the largest mass transit system in the world. The station included tiled arches, chandeliers and rose-tinted windows in the ceiling to let in light. By 1903, City Hall Park’s gas lighting fixtures were replaced with electric lampposts &#8211; several of which remain in use today. As skyscrapers began to define New York City’s skyline, in 1913 the 60-story Woolworth building was constructed on Broadway west of City Hall Park. It remained the world’s tallest building until 1930 when the Chrysler building was completed in midtown. In 1920, the Jacob Wrey Mould fountain was disassembled and replaced with a statue called &#8220;Civic Virtue&#8221;, which was relocated to Queens Borough Hall in 1941, During the years of the Great Depression, City Hall Park was used as a site of protest.<br>
8) 1939 to 1998: Renovation and Excavation<br>
During the administration of New York City’s 99th Mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses unveiled an ambitious plan to renovate City Hall Park. In 1939, the Federal Post Office was torn down, restoring the park to its original rectangular shape and re-establishing clear views of City Hall from St. Paul’s Church and Lower Broadway. But completion of the plan was stopped in mid-construction due to opposition from City Hall and community groups. In 1966, the exterior of City Hall was declared a city and national landmark. In 1978, the Delacorte family donated to City Hall Park a new fountain which stood on the site of this marker until 1999. In 1991, construction of a federal office building north of City Hall Park uncovered a portion of an African Burial Ground, used by New York City’s free and enslaved African-Americans throughout much of the 18th Century. The area was partially excavated and declared a city and national historic landmark. Throughout the second half of the 20th Century, City Hall Park continued to offer New Yorkers a place of relaxation around the civic and financial districts, but over time City Hall Park fell into neglect.<br>
9) 1999: The Restoration of City Hall Park
In the fall of 1999, New York City’s 107th Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, rededicated City Hall Park on behalf of seven-and-a- half million New Yorkers. These extensive renovations faithfully restored much of the original park geometry, with its unobstructed views of City Hall from St. Paul’s Chapel, while adding a central walkway and formal gardens. paved Areas were reduced and replaced with lawns and trees, and the granite base of the original 1871 Jacob Wrey Mould fountain were returned to the Park with exact replicas of its centerpiece and lights reconstructed from Mould’s designs. Portions of the original wrought iron fence around City Hall were recovered from a cemetery in Bloomingdale, New York, and provided the model for the current fence. the result is a new, dramatic setting for the City Hall of the largest, most historic and most diverse city in the United States. This re-birth of City Hall Park is intended to serve as a symbol for the ongoing renaissance of the entire City of New York. This restoration is dedicated to the future, in a spirit of appreciation for the struggles, sacrifices and accomplishments of those New Yorkers who have come before us. It is a final gift from the 20th Century to the New Yorkers of the 21st.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[The rock escarpment overlooking Harlem Valley forms the spine of northern Manhattan. Perched on this rise is the neighborhood of Sugar Hill, a part of Harlem which became home to many leading members of African-American society during the first half of the 20th century. This triangular parcel of law located at the foot of Highbridge Park commemorates the many luminaries who made their homes here.<br><br>
Sugar Hill was named in the 1920s for the sweet life enjoyed by those who lived here. Loosely bounded by West 145th and 155th Streets and by Edgecombe and Amsterdam Avenues, this hill boasts neighborly streets and an eclectic range of late 19th and early 20th century architectural styles, but is best known for the people who lived here. In the 1920s and ‘30s, an intellectual vanguard emerged within the African-American community, and its base was Harlem. Those who could afford it &#8211; singers and musicians, political activists, author and painters &#8211; made their homes in the Sugar Hill area, which was distinguished by the accomplishments, affluence and sophistication of its residents. The New Negro Movement of this time, later known as the Harlem Renaissance, was part of the intellectual fabric of this community, and Sugar Hill’s history is a reflection of that movement.<br><br>
Residents included political reformers W.E.B. DuBois, founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); Walter White, secretary of the NAACP; and the Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. Musicians and performers such as Paul Robeson, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and Billy Strayhorn also lived here. The field of arts and letters was represented by Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, Aaron Douglas, and William Stanley Braithwaite. Professionals included Thurgood Marshall, the first African American U.S. Supreme Court justice. Between the wars, these and many other luminaries created a unique sense of community on Sugar Hill. <br><br>
The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated several sections of Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill as historic districts between 2000 and 2002. In 2002, Sugar Hill in its entirety was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br><br>
In 2009, NYC Parks named this park feature Sugar Hill Luminaries Lawn in response to a request from a community group that was endorsed by Community Board 12 in Manhattan.

    <name><![CDATA[M’Finda Kalunga Garden]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Forsyth Street, New York, (In the median)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The M’Finda Kalunga Garden is named in memory of an African-American burial ground that was located on nearby Chrystie Street between Rivington and Stanton Streets.<br><br>
Dutch colonists brought the first enslaved Africans to the New Amsterdam colony in the late 1500s. By 1748, African-Americans, slave and free, made up 20% of the city’s population. In addition to being banned from membership in churches, at best relegated to balconies and back pews, New York’s black residents endured curfews, meeting prohibitions, and burial restrictions.<br><br>
In 1794, the African Burial ground near City Hall was closed, and by October of that year, the Common Council of New York City received &#8220;a petition from the Sunday Black men of the city praying the aid of this board in purchasing a piece of ground for the interment of their dead.&#8221; By April, the land was granted in what was deemed &#8220;a proper place,&#8221; near the dilapidated ruin of James Delancey’s mansion. The land purchase was bounded to the east by First Street (now Chrystie) and to the north and south by Stanton and Rivington Streets. By the late 1700s, the growing population of the city forced northern expansion. The burial ground began to deteriorate, and by
1853, it closed forever. The human remains were disinterred, and the site was soon built over. The M’Finda Kalunga Garden, just a few hundred feet away, memorializes this moment in history. M’Finda Kalunga means &#8220;Garden at the Edge of the Other Side of the World&#8221; in the Kikongo language.<br><br> 
The garden was founded in 1983, as a project of the Roosevelt Park Community Coalition. The coalition was formed in 1982 in response to an overwhelming drug problem in the park, created several committees to assess and solve the variety of problems facing the neighborhood. The original aims of the garden were more social than horticultural. The organizers viewed their work as a beachhead from which to launch initiatives that would make the community a better place to live. In the following years, more gardeners joined the project, and the garden began to take shape.<br><br>
About 20 regular gardeners now maintain individual beds and contribute to the upkeep of communal areas, such as the shrubbery and bulb plantings. The garden’s mailing list is nearly double this number. Keys and individual plots are earned on an apprenticeship basis, when would-be members work with current members on shared plots and demonstrate their commitment to maintaining the garden. Community business is handled in a democratic fashion at monthly meetings. Scheduled events include Clean-up Day, Kids Day, senior center hours, and fundraisers.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Hamilton Fish Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Pitt Street, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This park takes its name from a long line of public officials, Hamilton Fish (1808-1893). Hamilton’s father, Nicholas Fish (1758 &#8211; 1833), married Elizabeth Stuyvesant in 1803 and distinguished himself as Adjutant-General of New York State, Supervisor of the Revenue under President George Washington, and alderman of New York City. Hamilton Fish graduated from Columbia University and became a lawyer in 1830. His political career included terms as U.S. Representative, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State.<br><br>

The City of New York purchased the land for Hamilton Fish Park in 1897 as part of an effort initiated by State Legislature’s 1887 Small Parks Act. This pioneering law aimed to add open space in crowded neighborhoods, especially the Lower East Side. The park opened in 1900, complete with an ornate Beaux-Arts style gymnasium, the only original feature that survived to this day. Designed in 1898 by Carrere & Hastings, architects of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, the building takes its inspiration from a small garden pavilion in Paris Petit Palais. To emphasize the park’s formality, its architects placed a pair of small sculpted water fountains, grass parterres, and benches in straight rows behind the gymnasium. Only three years after its opening, a redesign made accommodations for active outdoor recreation including track and tennis.<br><br>
In 1936 the Works Progress Administration built an indoor swimming pool at Hamilton Fish. It was one of eleven pools constructed around the city that year. These new facilities opened during one of the hottest summers in history and in the middle of the Great Depression. Thanks to the WPA pools, millions of new Yorkers got a place to swim. In 1952 the U.S. Olympic Team used Hamilton Fish pool for practice sessions on their way in Helsinki.<br><br>

The gymnasium became an official New York City landmark in 1982, and in 1992 Parks completed a $14 million restoration of the entire park. In addition to refitting the gym as a recreation center, the project refurbished the basketball courts, handball courts, and the children’s playground.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[East River Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near South Street, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The East River Park runs alongside the Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Drive and the East River from Montgomery Street to East 12th Street. It was conceived in the early 1930s when Robert Moses (1888-1981) was designing the FDR (also known as the East River) Drive. Moses knew that the expressway would pass through the Lower East Side, a neighborhood sorely in need of parkland. He was determined not to let the land between the expressway and the river go to waste. Moses envisioned a tree-lined esplade with abundant recreational facilities and windswept views of the East River and beyond.<br><br>

Moses soon faced a problem: the acquisition of enough land for a park in this densely populated area. Condemnation, the process by which the City normally acquired land, was prohibitively expensive and fraught with legal difficulties, especially along this heavily industrialized waterfront. Moses arrived at an imaginative solution. To provide more parkland, he built a 10-foot wide concrete extension to Manhattan’s eastern shoreline spanning 20 blocks. The combination of the added platform and Moses’ legal wrangling was enough to secure the needed land, and in 1939, East River Park, the Lower East Side’s largest open space, opened alongside the FDR Drive.<br><br>
East River Park has undergone a great many changes since then. In 1949, when the FDR Drive was widened, a portion of the park between Montgomery and Jackson Streets was eliminated. South Street was extended in 1963, protruding onto another 30-foot section of the park. In 1951, Parks built the 10th Street pedestrian overpass above the FDR Drive, connecting the park with East River residents, especially allowing easy access to residents of the neighboring Lillian Ward Houses.<br><br>
An amphitheater was built in the park in 1941, along with an adjacent limestone recreational building, as part of an urban renewal project for the Lower East Side. Joseph Papp (1921-1991), founder of Shakespeare in the Park and the Public Theater, staged Julius Caesar there in 1956. During much of that decade, the amphitheater was the site of free Evening-in-the-Park concerts. Local schools held their graduation ceremonies there, and the group of Ancient Drama performed free productions of Greek classics. In 1973, however, the amphitheater closed due to budget shortage. Vandals attacked the neglected theater and by 1980 it was unusable.<br><br>
The East River waterfront has played a crucial role in the development of New York City. Before the arrival of Dutch colonists in the 17th century, it was home to the Nechtane, a subgroup of the Lenapes, Native Americans who once inhabited much of the New York area. After European settlers colonized the area, it formed a vital link in trade with Europe and the West Indies. By 1825, the area was marked by an active shipbuilding industry, boisterous masses of sailors, and a number of active municipal waterfront markets. In the mid-19th century, as sea trade moved to the deeper channels of the Hudson River, docks gave way to factories, and then, in the late 19th century, to tenements. By the time Moses developed his plan for the park, the southern East River waterfront was dotted with slaughterhouses, glass factories, power stations, and railroad yards.<br><br>
In recent years, the park has been the site of extensive renovations, including 1994 improvements to the basketball court, playground, and picnic area, and seawall. Renovation continued in 1996, when Parks celebrated the opening of the 10th Street comfort station, funded through the efforts of City Council Members Antonio Pagan and Kathryn Freed, with a First Flush ceremony. Commissioner Stern performed a ceremonial flush of the men’s room toilet and cut an inaugural toilet paper ribbon. In 2000, ballfield lighting improvements were completed with funding provided by City Council member Margarita Lopez. A bikeway was completed in 2001 with funding from Mayor Giuliani and Borough President C. Virginia Fields.<br><br>
The park is a popular recreation area. in addition to its views of the East River, it boasts basketball, tennis, and handball courts; playgrounds; a picnic area; softball, football, baseball and track fields; a river promenade; and a footbridge. The Brian Watkins Tennis Club, which opened in 1991, is named for a 22-year old Utah tourist who was slain while attempting to protect his parents from a subway mugger. The tennis club honors Watkin’s avid interest in tennis, offering free tennis lessons six months a year.<br><br>

There, he awaited the arrival of his fiancée, Anna Murray, a free Black woman from Maryland. They married, and together continued Bailey’s freedom journey to Massachusetts where he changed his name to Douglass. Lauded for his oration, he became a prominent abolitionist and purchased his legal freedom from slavery. Publisher of the abolitionist journal The North Star, he championed freedom for all Americans and endorsed women’s suffrage. Douglass later held posts as the Assistant Secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission (1871), Marshall of the District of Columbia (1877-1881) and U.S. Minister to Haiti (1889-1891). Following the death of his wife in 1884, Douglass married Helen Pitts. He died in Washington, D.C. on February 20, 1895.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[For nearly two centuries, this block, bounded by Orchard, Allen, Delancy and Broome Streets, has been a first home for immigrants, and has been shaped and reshaped by generations of newcomers<br><br>
Early 1880s<br>
During the early 1800s, American-born, workers of English, Scottish and protestant Irish-descent inhabited wood and brick two- and three-story single-family homes, which lined the dirt street and sometimes housed small shops or factories. Beginning in the 1840s, the area surrounding Orchard Street became home to large numbers of German immigrants.<br><br>
1863<br>
In 1828, on the site where 95, 97 and 99 Orchard Street now stand, the Orchard Street Dutch Reformed Church was built. In 1863, German-born tailors Jacob Walter, Lukas Glockner and Adam Stumm purchased the church property and immediately divided it into three building lots. The church was soon demolished, and the three men erected the block’s first purpose-built tenements on their individual lots.<br><br>
1900<br>
By 1900, this block was the most densely populated place on earth &#8211; home to 2,223 people on 2.04 acres &#8211; most of whom were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Three years later, in 1903, the northern end of the block was truncated to widen Delancy Street as an approach to the newly built Williamsburg bridge, and three buildings on each side of the street were demolished. Then, in 1913, the three individual tenements at 103, 105 and 107 Orchard Street were joined to make one corner building.<br><br>
1930s<br>
Orchard Street has been home to countless businesses over the past two hundred years: from lager beer saloons and groceries in the late 1800s to undergarment shops and dry goods stores in the early 1900s. When a significant number of tenements on Orchard Street were vacated during the 1930s, Orchard Street’s profile as a commercial center assures adequate rents from the shops alone and, therefore, the survival of the buildings.<br><br>
1988<br>
In 1988, 97 Orchard Street was rediscovered by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum which was searching for a home in which the history of tenement life and the diverse immigrant experience on the Lower East Side could be brought to life.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This basketball court is named in honor of Gregory Marius (1958-2017), founder of the popular Entertainers Basketball Classic at Rucker Park. Born in Harlem on March 18, 1958, Gregory Alexander Marius was a lifelong Harlem resident.<br><br>
Marius founded the Entertainers Basketball Classic in 1982, when he was a young rapper in with the Disco Four. Initially organized as a tournament between rival hip-hop crews, Marius’s basketball showcase ingeniously connected the worlds of basketball and hip-hop. Expanding on Rucker Park’s existing history as a place where neighborhood talent could play sports celebrities, Marius invited basketball stars to the weeks-long tournament. The growing number of players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) drew enormous crowds, and in 1984 the tournament moved from Fred Samuel Playground (formerly Readers Digest Park) to Holcombe Rucker Park.<br><br>
Since its founding, NBA superstars like Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Lebron James, and Shaquille O'Neal have held court at the Classic. In the 1990s, Marius expanded his vision integrated entertainers like Michael Bivins, Fat Joe, Jay Z, P. Diddy, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Mary J. Blige in the program. Political and business leaders such as United States President Bill Clinton and NBA Commissioner David Stern have also joined the jubilant crowds at the Entertainers Basketball Classic.<br><br>
On April 22, 2017, Gregory Marius passed away after his battle with cancer, but his legacy will live on in Harlem. Gus Wells and Cordell Marius, co-commissioners of Entertainers Basketball Classic, will keep Gregory Marius’ dream alive. In June 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio named Rucker Park’s basketball court Greg Marius Court, after the man who helped changed the culture of streetball in New York City.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Holcombe Rucker Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On West 155th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Holcombe Rucker (1926-1965) is remembered here for the major basketball tournaments he founded at this court, and for the generations of players that emerged under his wing. Born and raised in Manhattan and schooled at Benjamin Franklin High School, Rucker worked between 1948 and 1964 as a Playground Director for NYC Parks at various Harlem playgrounds. Rucker’s main purpose was to train local kids so that they could better compete on the court and in life.<br><br>
His career flourished at this playground. Rucker’s tournaments became summertime rituals and drew upon the talent in the neighborhood. Under his guidance, young local players cut their teeth on some of the most acrobatic streetball of their time. The game of streetball &#8211; a rougher and often faster version of basketball played outdoors &#8211; gained currency here because Rucker’s tournaments combined the skills of both streetball and professional indoor basketball.<br><br>
Rucker’s motto on the court was &#8220;each one, teach one,&#8221; which stressed the importance of passing on what you learn to your neighbor. Rucker emphasized not only physical skill and discipline on the court, but education as a necessary partner to recreation. Rucker himself taught the players reading fundamentals, graded their homework, and let success on report cards influence who would get to play. By the 1950’s, Rucker had started the ‘Rucker Tournament’, out of which came some 700 college athletic scholarships. Rucker continued his own education with a degree from the City College of New York in 1962, and then taught English classes at Frederick Douglass J.H.S. 139. Rucker continued to build on the accomplishments of his students when he organized a tournament amongst his best amateur players and the professionals of that era. Such legends as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul Jabbar came out to play.<br><br>
Basketball is traditionally thought of as a winter sport, with the playoffs in spring. When Rucker opted to hold his training and tournaments throughout the summer, he met with opposition from local officials. Rucker argued that the summer was the best time to organize and train local kids, if only so that they stayed off of the street. Rucker persisted and prevailed, and his summertime tournaments are now held in his honor. Basketball became a four season sport.<br><br>
Rucker died prematurely, at age 38, due to complications from cancer, leaving his wife Mary Thomas and many devoted followers. In the months following his death, two of his protégés &#8211; Bob McCullough (drafted by the NBA Cincinnati Royals) and Fred Crawford (drafted by the NBA NY Knicks) &#8211; created the Rucker Pro League, a competition among professionals held each summer here at Rucker Playground. In the spirit of Rucker’s legacy, this tournament is always preceded by one amongst the amateur players, called the &#8220;Each One Teach One&#8221; tournament.<br><br>
In the late 1960s and ‘70s, the Rucker Pro League reached a high point when such esteemed players as Connie Hawkins, Tiny Archibald, Julius ‘Dr. J’ Erving, Tony Jackson, Calvin Ramsey, and Willis Reed played on this court. The amateur teams included legendary streetball players such as Joe ‘the Destroyer’ Hammond, Herman ‘Helicopter’ Knowling, Peewee Kirkland, Earl ‘the Goat’ Manigault, and Pablo Robertson. By the early 1980s, professional athletes were less active in the competition, for fear of injury during non-season play, and the league returned to its amateur roots. Today Rucker’s original tournament is played at Colonel Charles Young Playground at 145th Street near the Harlem River. Most recently, the Golden Hoops East Coat High School Basketball Classic tournament has become part of this tradition.<br><br>
For over 50 years the Each One Teach One summer league, also founded by McCullough and Crawford, has called Rucker Park home. This annual summer youth league has been instrumental in developing young players, and cultivating academic growth and community building. In addition to weekend tournaments, Each One Teach One offers daily skills clinics to kids age six to thirteen.<br><br>
The Entertainers Basketball Classic, a celebrated annual tournament that marries basketball and music, moved to this court in 1985. Founded by Gregory Marius, this tournament enjoins top players from all ranks &#8211; high school, college, and professional.<br><br>
The park opened February 23, 1956, as a ‘Jointly Operated Playground’ owned by the Department of Education and managed by NYC Parks, but in 1974, at the request of Rucker’s protégés, Mayor John V. Lindsay issued a local law officially naming this site Holcombe Rucker Playground. The tournaments at Rucker court have been the subject of three films, <i>Above the Rim, On Hallowed Ground</i> and <i>The Real: Rucker Pro Legends and Fathers of the Sport.</i> These films, Rucker’s devotion to the game and community, and the continued dedication of his pupils have secured the park’s place in basketball history.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[In 1805, the land between Bowery, Broadway, 4th Street and Astor Place became the fashionable Vauxhall Garden. Established by Joseph Delacroix on land owned by John Jacob Astor, it featured gravel walks amount shrubs trees, flowers, and equestrian statue of George Washington and an open-air theatre for concerts, plays and hot-air balloon launches. According to one source, its dazzle of music, fireworks, lamp-lit arbors, ice cream and juleps made it &#8220;as gay a place of recreation as was to be found at the period of an evening anywhere in the civilized world.&#8221;<br><br>
In 1826, Astor cut Lafayette Place through the garden’s middle, selling the lots to its west at great profit. In 1840 and 1841, P.T. Barnum leased the Vauxhall’s saloon, presenting variety acts. The Garden’s decline was hastened by the bloody 1849 Astor Place Riot, during which some of the bloody bodies were laid across the Vauxhall’s Saloon billiard tables. Vauxhall Garden closed in 1859, after over 50 years of existence at this spot.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[On May 10, 1849, one of NYC’s largest riots occurred on this square at the Astor Place Opera House. Blamed on long-standing trans-Atlantic rivalry between famous Shakespearean actors &#8211; American-born Edwin Forrest and Englishman Edward Macready &#8211; the event was also the culmination of years of ethnic and class resentments against the city’s Anglophile elite. While the rich embraced Macready’s refined style, the masses championed Forrest’s muscular approach. Class war erupted with their rival productions of Macbeth &#8211; Forrest’s at the Broadway Theatre below Canal, and Macready’s at the fancy Astor Place Opera House which required kid gloves and clean shaves.<br><br>
&#8220;Shall Americans or English rule in this city/&#8221; read leaflets, challenging nativist Bowery Boys and Irish anger over the Famine. On May 7th, hundreds attended and shut down Macready’s performance by hurling insults, eggs and chairs. Three nights later, thousands converged on the Opera House. Refusing to disperse, rocks were thrown through windows and at the State Militia, who fired into the crowd, killing some 30 people, many just bystanders.<br><br>
Macready fled to England, never to return. The reviled &#8220;DisAstor Place Opera House&#8221; soon closed. As disparity between rich and poor increased, theaters ceased being democratic gathering places, and instead were segregated by economic class.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art is America’s first free college. Founded by progressive thinker/abolitionist/inventor Peter Cooper, its doors were opened to all, regardless of race, religion, gender or social status.<br><br>
Its famous Greta Hall has been a bastion of free speech and progressivism, presenting great minds, talents and the burning issues of the day. Lincoln’s anti-slavery &#8220;Right Makes Might&#8221; speech (2/27/1860), propelled him to the presidency. A 1909 speech by Clara Lemich sparked the uprising of 20,000 shirtwaist workers. Other appearances include Mark Twain, Frederick Douglass, Chief Red Cloud, Susan B. Anthony, Emma Goldman, Mother Jones, Nikola Tesla, Clarence Darrow, P.T. Barnum, William Randolph Hearst, Andrew Carnegie, W.E.B. DuBois, Bertrand Russell, Margaret Mead, Orson Wells, Allen Ginsburg, Billy Joel, Philip Glass, Steven Colbert and Presidents Grant, Cleveland, Taft, T. Roosevelt, Wilson, Clinton, and Obama.<br><br>
Prominent alumni include Nobel physicist Russell Hulse, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Max Fleischer and Freedom Tower’s Daniel Libeskind.<br><br>
Peter Cooper (1791-1883) was successively a laborer, clerk, mechanic, inventor, manufacturer, financier, philanthropist, philosopher, and presidential candidate. He built America’s first Steam locomotive, invented powdered gelatin and founded the company that laid the first Transatlantic Cable.<br><br>
Frederick A. Peterson’s design for Cooper Union’s Foundation Building was the earliest to employ rolled iron beams. Built 1854-1859, the stately Anglo-Italianate brownstone is a NYC landmark.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[For over seventy-five years, this building housed the administrative offices, a spacious retail store and presses that printed millions of copies of Sheet music distributed world-wide. In 1872, German-born Carl Fischer (1849-1923) opened a musical instrument repair shop nearby on 4th Street, and soon expanded into instrument sales and sheet music publishing. After establishing a reputation as the publisher of band music, including that of John Philip Sousa, the company later became a leading publisher of classical music, such as compositions by Jascha Heifetz and Sergei Rachmaninoff.<br><br>
By 1880, Fischer had moved to larger quarters on Cooper Square and in 1922 commissioned architect W.K. Benedict to design this 12-story, Neo-Classica; building of steel and reinforced concrete with brick and limestone facing. The company moved its headquarters to Bleeker Street in 1999, and Wall Street in 2013. The sheet music has been replaced by treadmills, the presses by condominiums.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This Italianate style building reflects the changing nature of the Bowery following the Civil War when two and three story Federal style houses were replaced by larger multi-purpose buildings. One of architect Nicholas Whyte’s earliest projects, he lavished this 1868 commission with an elaborate use of limestone lintels, sills and quoins set off against red brick walls. The second story Bowery façade is cast-iron with large two-over-two window panes. The slate-clad mansard roof is punctuated by a four-story corner tower and round-arch dormer windows.<br><br>
Although originally intended to be a store and dwelling, the upper floors soon became a warehouse. In 1894, it operated as a hotel and, in 1915, a shop and factory. Several long-term tenants included two hat shops - Herman Rosenberg Hats (c. 1935-60) and the Universal Hat manufacturing Company (c. 1935-1975) &#8211; and two hardware stores &#8211; Morris Feuer Hardware (c. 1920-55) and Bleeker Hardware Company (c. 1935-75). This restored corner, in the NoHo East Historic District, now houses loft apartments and the restaurant Saxon & Parole, named in honor of two 19th century prize-winning horses.<br><br>

According to baseball historian John Thorn, the Gothams &#8211; who formed in 1837 &#8211; were America’s first organized baseball team and the first to write down the rules of the game. The first conventions for the National Association for Base Ball Players were held here in 1857-1858, later moving up the street to Cooper Union when it grew bigger. The Association’s rules committee met here as late as 1865.<br><br>
From 1879 to 1898, this current 4-story structure was a popular &#8220;dime museum.&#8221; With cheaply priced exhibits and stage shows typical of such venues, the Globe Dime Museum featured giant snakes, magicians and curiosities like &#8220;Trimuta, the Three-Headed Songstress.&#8221;<br><br>
It hosted future film comedian W.C. Fields’ first NYC appearances and the premiere of vaudeville comic due Weber & Fields’ famous &#8220;Dutch&#8221; routine as German immigrants.<br><br>

Known by anti-vice crusaders as Paresis Hall, it was owned by gangster James T. &#8220;Biff&#8221; Ellison, who reportedly operated it as a male brothel. Memoirist Ralph Werther recalled the hall differently, as an &#8220;innocuous&#8221; gathering place for upper and middle class female-impersonators. The upstairs was rented to &#8220;Cercie Hermaphroditos,&#8221; a club formed &#8220;to unite for defense against the world’s bitter persecution&#8221; of androgynous men. Historians Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace consider this one of America’s earliest documented gay right organizations. Paresis Hall figures prominently in Caleb Carr’s 1994 novel, <i>The Alienist</i>.<br><br>
Historian George Chauncey suggests that a gay subculture could exist on the Bowery because of its diverse mix of people and heavy concentration of theatres, saloons and red-light elements made it more tolerant of those outside the cultural mainstream.<br><br>

Advertised as &#8220;The roughest joint in town,&#8221; McGurk’s attracted the lowest of low-brow clientele &#8211; from criminals and prostitutes to gamblers and rowdy sailors &#8211; all kept in line by its ferocious staff of bouncers and waiters. A disturbing trend surfaced in the saloon’s backroom in 1897, after a couple of down-and-out prostitutes attempted suicide by mixing carbolic acid and a shot of whiskey. Owner John McGurk capitalized on the macabre tradition by boldly renaming it Suicide Hall.<br><br>
Soon, visitors lined up to visit the saloon, in hopes of glimpsing the gruesome acts in person. In all, at least ten women committed suicide here.<br><br>
Though shut down in 1902, McGurk’s was for decades referenced in novels and films such as Mae West’s raunchy Broadway homage, <i>She Done Him Wrong</i> (1933). The 1863 building later became a lodging house and then artists lofts. In the mid-2000s, Feminist writer Kate Millett (<i>Sexual Politics</i>), who resided here, led a valiant effort to landmark it and establish a museum memorial to the prostitutes who died there.<br><br>

Among those who may have learned it from Maurer was Harry Houdini, who worked across the street at the Globe Dime Museum (298 Bowery) and was briefly billed as the &#8220;King of Cards&#8221;.<br><br>
With world-famous magicians performing on the Bowery, Otto Maurer’s shop was a popular attraction for over 20 years. In addition to Houdini, who played both the Globe and Miner’s Bowery Theatre (165-167 Broadway), John Henry Anderson, the &#8220;Great Wizard of the North,&#8221; played the Bowery Theatre (46-48 Bowery), and Hermann the Great played the Windsor Theatre (45-47 Bowery) and People’s Theatre (199 Bowery). It was indeed a magical time on the Bowery.<br><br>]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Fifth Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
The historic Arsenal is one of two buildings in Central Park predating the park. It was designed by esteemed architect Martin T. Thompson (1786-1877) and built between 1847 and 1851 by the State of New York as a storage repository for the storage of munitions. Thompson designed a fortress-like stuccoed structure, with a crenulated cornice and rooftop turrets. The cast-iron eagle over the doorway is also an original feature. The project’s funding was overseen by state Comptroller Millard Fillmore, later President of the United States.<br><br>
The building’s military use was short-lived, and in 1857 the City purchased the Arsenal for $275,000, removed all arms, and established park administrative functions on the premises. Over the ensuing decades it has served diverse roles. At the outset the 11th Police Precinct was stationed here. In 1859 the Menagerie (later the zoo) was created in and around the Arsenal. When the American Museum of Natural History was founded, its first home was the Arsenal, from 1869 to 1877; also at that time B. Waterhouse Hawkins, an eminent British paleontologist, set up a studio of the second and third floors, where he reconstructed dinosaur skeletons.<br><br>
A Gallery of Art occupied the first floor in the early 1870s, and the Municipal Weather Bureau’s instruments were kept on the Arsenal roof from 1869 to 1918. The building fell into disrepair, and was largely vacant from 1914 to 1924, when it underwent a renovation that added the central turrets and clock facing the zoo.<br><br>
When Robert Moses (1888-1981) was appointed the first citywide Parks Commissioner in 1934, the Arsenal again underwent extensive renovation and the stucco was removed from the exterior brickwork. The lavish murals inspired by images of old New York in the lobby were part of a Works Progress Administration project in 1935-36 by artist Allan Sallburg (1899-1987). The front entrance was also redesigned to include military-style decorative drums over the door, and cast-iron musket replicas supporting the bannisters.<br><br>
In 1967, the Arsenal was designated an official city landmark. Since 1976, the central chamber on the third floor has been used as a public gallery. Its military origins long ago replaced by civilian functions, the historic Arsenal is home today to Parks’ central administration and Wildlife Conservation Society.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[You are standing in front of the 1970s home of the Tin Palace, a vital part of New York’s alternative music scene. Originally a Federal-style 3-story, built circa 1830, it was allegedly a speakeasy run by gangster Meyer Lansky in the 1920s. In 1970, writer Paul Pines and partners converted the rundown property into a club that presented Brazilian music and jazz, wanting &#8220;to build up a grass-roots place not to make a killing at the door.&#8221; When writer Stanley Crouch and saxophonist David Murray moved in upstairs, they convinced Pines to add a Sunday avant-garde jazz series. Pines left in 1976, but Crouch continued the club’s innovative spirit.<br><br>
Until it closed in 1980, the Tin Palace was a destination for musicians and fans from around the world. The club continually fostered the most dynamic contemporary music, from Eddie Jefferson/Richie Cole and Shelia Jordan/Roswell Rudd, to Jimmy Guiffre, James Blood Ulmer, Leroy Jenkins, Roscoe Mitchell, Paul Bley, Steve Swallow and Kalaparusha Maurice McIntyre. It staged the first performances of the long-lived World Saxophone Quartet.&#8221;(sic)

    <desc><![CDATA[The Bond Street Savings Bank, completed in 1874, became known as the German Exchange Bank by 1879, catering to a growing German population in this area, which became known as <i>Kleinedeutschland</i> (Little Germany). Although the facades of this Italianate style building are all cast iron, the intended impression is of a great stone structure with Ionic columns, ornamental pediments, corners braced by quoining and cornices on every floor.<br><br>
In 1963, Honey Waldman and Bruce Becker converted the bank into the Bouwerie Lane Theatre, opening with Frank Langella in Andre Gide’s <i>The Immortalist</i>. Later productions included <i>The Palm Casino Review</i>, with members of the Cockettes, and <i>Dames at Sea</i>, which made Bernadette Peters a star.<br><br>
From 1974 to 2006, this was home to the Obie Award-winning Jean Cocteau Repertory Company, whose over 200 productions included premieres of the Bentley/Milhaud version of Brecht’s <i>Mother Courage</i> and <i>Something Cloudy, Something Clear</i>, Tennessee Williams' last play to premiere in NYC during his lifetime.<br><br>

In contains 156 underground family vaults the size of small rooms, surrounded by 12-foot-high Greek Revival-style walls of Tuckahoe marble. There are no headstones for the 2,100 burials; only plaques on walls naming family purchasers and corresponding vault numbers.<br><br>
Interments include NYC’s second popularly elected mayor, Aaron Clark; NYU co-founder and abolitionist Congressman James Tallmadge; Mary Ann Delafield DuBois, NY Nursery & Child’s Hospital founder; Erie Canal engineer Benjamin Wright; and New York Historical Society founder Luman Reed, who founded the city’s first art museum in his home. Though burials slowed in the mid-1800s as families sought plots in more rural areas, a 1905 fundraising effort helped maintain the cemetery for the 20th century, just as rental events like weddings assure survival into the 21st.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[You are standing in front of one of the best-preserved reminders of <i>Kleindeutschland</i> - &#8220;Little Germany&#8221; &#8211; once the most prominent German-American neighborhood in America. Fleeing economic and political instability, Germans began immigrating here in the 1840s, and by 1855 New York contained the third largest urban population of Germans in the world.<br><br>
By 1870, Little Germany covered much of the present-day East Village and Lower East Side, with the Bowery the hub of its commercial and social life, including the beautiful Germania Bank building and the popular Atlantic Garden beer hall (see 190 and 50 Bowery). That same year, the Germania Fire Insurance Company opened a branch here to capitalize on property owners’ need for safeguards against an urban threat that had decimated large sections of the city. The building’s architect was Carl Pfeiffer, a native of Germany who later designed the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.<br><br>
After the 1904 General Slocum disaster, in which a fire on an excursion steamer killed over one thousand people, most of them women and children, Germans began leaving Kleindeutschland for other areas. Once a centerpiece of Bowery immigrant life, the Germania Fire Insurance Building was declared a NYC landmark in 2010.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[Prior to its maritime prominence, the Peck Slip area accommodated New York’s first brick built market. Constructed by wealthy residents, Peck Slip market was the trading center of a thriving community at Peck Slip and Pearl Street between 1763 and 1793.<br><br>
After being filled in 1800, Peck Slip became a hub of maritime industry. Local businessman, Jasper Ward, realized its potential and purchased this reclaimed land. He built three warehouses between 41 and 45 Peck Slip &#8211; prime locations for harbor related industry. Number 45 survives at the intersection with South Street, preserved by the South Street Seaport historic district. (sic)<br><br>
The seaport thrived on the fishing and ferry trade. Schooners, magnificent ships with multiple masts and sails, filled the harbor. The schooners proved so enduring that many remained in use even after steamboat development. A New York schooner ‘C S Allison&#8221; survived 106 years &#8211; one of history’s longest serving vessels. The inaugural America’s Cup was won by a schooner, the ‘Magic’, in New York bay on August 8, 1970 (sic).<br><br>
Often moored at the Slip (sic) were mighty Blackball Packets. These huge ships were part of a successful shipping line launched in 1817, offering the first regularly scheduled service from New York to Liverpool, England.<br><br>
Piers 25-27, once located on this waterfront, were used by the Steamboat (sic) lines that regularly served the east coast U.S. ports.<br><br>
On December 26, 1853, the &#8220;Great Republic’, the largest clipper ship ever built, caught fire while moored at Dover Street. This was one of the East River’s biggest maritime disasters and the ship was scuttled.<br><br>
Today, Peck Slip remains only in name but in the early morning, at Fulton Fish market just to the south, one can still sample the flavor of the former working seaport.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Left panel:<br>
The Brooklyn Bridge was the greatest engineering feat of its era and remains one of the best-loved bridges in the world. It was the vision of the German immigrant and engineer John A. Roebling and completed by his son Washington, an engineer and Civil War veteran. When the younger Roebling fell ill he was assisted by his wife Emily. The bridge was built primarily by hand over a 15-year period &#8211; from 1869 to 1883. As many as 600 people worked on the Bridge at a time and 27 lives were lost during the construction. The average age of the staff of engineers who oversaw the project was 31. When it opened to the public on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world and the tallest man-made structure on the continent &#8211; towering over the New York City skyline<br><br>
Right panel<br>
&#8220;When the perfected bridge shall permanently and uninterruptedly connect the two cities (of New York and Brooklyn), the daily thousands who cross it will consider it a sort of natural and inevitable phenomenon, such as the rising and setting of the sun, and they will unconsciously overlook the preliminary difficulties surmounted before the structure spanned the stream, and will perhaps undervalue the indomitable courage, the absolute faith, the consummate genius which assured the engineer’s triumph.&#8221;<br>

CBGB was the brainchild of Hilly Kristal (1931-2007), a former marine who played violin and guitar, sang at Radio City Music Hall and managed the Village Vanguard before starting the Rheingold Central Park Music Festival and opening Hilly’s on 9th Street. In 1973, he opened CBGB, intending to book Country/BlueGrass/Blues, but drifted into rock. OMFUG means Other Music for Uplifting Gormandizers. Sacrificing all to make his vision a reality, he took odd jobs to make ends meet. He rejected cover music, stressing instead a nurturing commitment to new songs and new bands.<br><br>
Despite a high profile campaign to save the club after a protracted legal dispute with Hilly’s landlord, CBGB closed on October 15, 2006. Battling cancer, he died in 2007.

    <desc><![CDATA[The 1811 Commissioners’ Plan, the far-reaching gridiron pattern which laid out the streets and avenues of Manhattan, had little immediate impact on the western part of Greenwich Village. The grid was intended to provide a system for the orderly development of land between 14th Street and Washington Heights. However the geography of the West Village had evolved in an unregulated fashion since colonial days, emerging from marshland to farmland and then from a rural suburb to a densely-settled residential, commercial, and industrial neighborhood full of crooked streets.<br><br> Not until the 1910s and 1920s were Seventh and Eighth Avenues extended south of 14th Street. As a result, a number of small irregular parcels were created, including the traffic island at Charles Street, Waverly Place, and Seventh Avenue South. This parcel was acquired as a street and developed by the Borough President of Manhattan. In 1943, by Local Law 16, the City Council named the site in memory of Private First Class Bernard Joseph McCarthy, who was born and raised in Greenwich Village. A Marine, McCarthy was killed at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August 1942 at the age of twenty-two. His was the first reported death of a Greenwich Village resident in the war.<br><br> McCarthy Square’s original central flagpole once stood on the grounds of the 1939-1940 World’s Fair in Flushing, Queens, but has since been replaced. After the original was moved to this site it was embellished with an inscribed base of Deer Isle granite on behalf of neighborhood residents and the Dr. George A. Hayunga Maritime Post #1069 of the American Legion. Both the park and the memorial flagstaff were dedicated in June of 1943 and pay tribute to a brave son of Greenwich Village, the first to fall for his country in World War II.<br><br>

In a radical departure for modern architects at the time, Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates carefully considered the context of the surrounding neighborhood, and the Tudor City complex in particular, while planning the building’s design. The resulting building is an innovative, elegant, and transparent glass cube just twelve stories tall, framed in exposed cor-ten steel and mahogany-colored granite.

This tree and the one to the south were transplanted by Maciunas from a nearby abandoned lot. When city officials confronted Maciunas, he suggested they remove the tiny trees themselves; they never returned.

    <name><![CDATA[Golden Swan Garden]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On West 4th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Situated on the southeast corner of the intersection of West Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue, this newly created viewing garden rests on what was once the site of the Golden Swan Café. A gilded life&#8212;size figure of a swan was perched outside the three-story brick building, which was constructed in the mid-1800s. The operator of the Irish saloon &#8211; known to regulars as the Hell-Hole &#8211; was Thomas Wallace, a former prizefighter who also lived upstairs. Wallace died on the premises in 1922, but not before his tavern becoming the haunt of neighborhood artists and writers including the American playwright, Eugene Gladstone O’Neill (1888-1953).<br><br>
As a member of the theater troupe the Provincetown Players, O’Neill was often at their playhouse on MacDougal Street and frequently dropped in to drink at the Golden Swan. In a 1919 letter to his first wife Agnes, O’Neill recounts a trip to the Hell Hole in the midst of the Prohibition era, where he says there was no whiskey at the time but sherry was still relatively cheap at 20 cents a drink. On hearing that a song by Lefty Louie, a Hell Hole bartender, would soon be performed on Broadway, O’Neill wrote, &#8220;I think all the hours seemingly wasted in the HH. would soon be justified if they had resulted in only this.&#8221; His astute observations about human nature came to influence his many works and brought him widespread recognition on Broadway and around the world. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936 and Pulitzer Prizes for four of his plays. In fact, the Golden Swan served as part of the basis for the setting of O’Neill’s <i>The Iceman Cometh</i>, first produced on Broadway in 1946 and later revived in 1956. With a cast including Jason Robards, this production was directed by Jose Quintero at Circle in the Square Theatre’s original location at Sheridan Square, not far from this site. The play’s main characters were modeled after people O’Neill knew and met at the saloon, including Henry Hope, based on real-life proprietor Wallace.<br><br>
O’Neill was one of the many writers, artists, intellectuals and activists who were attracted to Greenwich Village, its cheap rent, and quaint brownstones in the early 1900s. It was here - nurtured in its sundry cafes, taverns, and restaurants &#8211; that a unique, revolutionary spirit of creative energy and freedom of thought blossomed and shaped the Village’s bohemian character. The Village’s first tearoom, called the Mad Hatter, once stood directly to the east of this garden at 150 West Fourth Street. The site of this garden was also inspiration for painter John French Sloan (1871-1951), who came to New York in 1904 and worked for some time as a freelance illustrator. With Robert Henri, he organized an exhibition of a group of urban realist painters, known as &#8220;the Eight&#8221; or the &#8220;Ashcan School’&#8221; who challenged traditional notions of art. Having moved to the Village in 1912, Sloan lived with his wife Dolly at 240 West 4th Street and at 88 Washington Place. He also had an eleventh-floor studio at 35 Sixth Avenue, a triangular building on the southwest corner across the street from this garden.<br><br>
During a clandestine midnight picnic at the top of the Washington Arch in nearby Washington Square Park on January 23, 1917, Sloan and a group of actors and artists including Marcel Duchamp went so far as to declare Greenwich Village its own independent nation. The scene depicted in Sloan’s <i>Arch Conspirators</i> (1917) in one of his many works that give a glimpse of city life during his time. In 1917, Sloan also made an etching of the interior of the Hell Hole, in which Eugene O’Neil is portrayed sitting at a table in the upper-right hand corner. His painting <i> The City from Greenwich Village </i>, included a view of this corner, looking downtown towards the Financial District, with the Sixth Avenue elevated train crossing the street.<br><br>
In 1928, the Golden Swan building was demolished for the construction of the Sixth Avenue subway. On June 8, 1934, by permit from the Board of Transportation, Parks was given jurisdiction over this parcel of land, and a playground was opened to the public here on October 14, 1935. The property was officially assigned to Parks by the Board of Estimate on August 27, 1953, and it is one of several small parks in the area that line Sixth Avenue &#8211; including the adjacent West 4th Street Courts, Minetta Green, Minetta Square, Minetta Lane Playground, Churchill Square and Charlton Plaza. Continuing in the innovative traditions of the neighborhood, the site was used as a recycling center in the 1980s. The Village Green Recycling Team held a champagne reception here on January 6, 1984 to kick off a program of collecting newspapers, glass, aluminum, and tin for recycling every Saturday. The recycling program ended with the advent of large-scale recycling by the Department of Sanitation in the 1900s.<br><br>
In 1999, Mayor Giuliani contributed $80,000 for a Requirements Contract to begin to turn this formerly bedraggled open patch of asphalt and concrete into a garden. Council Member Christine Quinn allocated $158,000 in additional capital funding to complete the renovation of the garden, including the installation of new granite curbs, an ornamental steel fence, a toolshed and a jardinière urn. Completed in winter of 2000, the garden also features bluestone and asphalt block paths, and a number of trees such as the Japanese Dogwood <i>(Cornus kousa)</i>, Flowering dogwood <i>(Coirnua florida)</i>, Serbian spruce <i>(Picea omorika)</i>, Japanese maple (Acer japonica)<i>, Dawn redwood <i>(Metasequora glyptostroboides)</i>, and Saucer magnolia <i>(Magnolia x soulangiana)</i>.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[George Washington Statue]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On East 14th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This impressive bronze equestrian portrait of George Washington (1732-1799), the first President of the United States, is the oldest sculpture in the New York City parks collection. It was modeled by Henry Kirke Brown (1814-1886) and dedicated in 1856.<br><br>
George Washington was born into a prosperous family on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was privately educated and gained experience as a land surveyor, before joining the militia. He served as an officer in the French and Indian Wars from 1755-1758. After rising to the rank of colonel, he resigned his post and married Martha Dandridge (1731-1802), returning as a gentleman farmer to the family plantation at Mount Vernon, Virginia.<br><br>
He soon reentered public life, and served in succession as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses (1759-74), and as a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses (1774-75). Upon the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, Washington was made Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. His military prowess and inspirational leadership held the colonial armies together against overwhelming odds, and secured the evacuation and defeat of the British in 1783.<br><br>
Washington again retired to Mount Vernon, but his dissatisfaction with the new provisional government caused him to resume an active role, and in 1787, he presided over the second federal constitutional convention in Philadelphia. He was then unanimously chosen first president of the United States, and was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789. Washington was reelected to a second term in 1793, declined a third term, and retired from political life in 1797. Often referred to as &#8220;the father of our country,&#8221; Washington is universally regarded as having been instrumental in winning the American revolution and in establishing the new nation.<br><br>
In 1851, a committee of concerned citizens interested in erecting a monument to Washington in New York approached sculptor Horatio Greenough (1805-1852), known for his huge classical marble portrait of Washington. Simultaneously, the committee also invited Henry Kirke Brown to submit a design, though it was unclear whether he was to assist Greenough or compete with him for artistic selection. Any prospect of collaboration evaporated with Greenough’s premature death in December 1852.<br><br>
Though Brown, like many of his generation, made an obligatory visit to Italy to study, he was part of a group of sculptors attempting to establish a truly American sculptural idiom. His first major public commission was a statue of DeWitt Clinton (1769-1828) which he completed for Greenwood cemetery in 1852. Working at a specially equipped studio in Brooklyn, and assisted extensively by John Quincy Adams Ward (1830-1910), who himself would attain renown as a sculptor, Brown spent 18 months modeling the horse and rider.<br><br>
The moment brown depicts is that of Evacuation Day, November 25, 1783, when Washington reclaimed the city from the British. With outstretched hand, he signals to the troops in a gesture of benediction, a sculptural motif indebted to precedents from antiquity, most notably the Marcus Aurelius statue on Rome’s Capitaline Hill. Yet Brown’s attention to detail, and the life with which he infuses his subject, united classical gestures and pose with what has been described as a &#8220;simple and direct naturalism.&#8221; The piece was cast at the Ames foundry in Chicopee, Massachusetts, one of the first foundries in the United States capable of such large-scale quality work. The names of the donors are inscribed on the skyward face of the bronze sub-base. Brown also sculpted the statue of Abraham Lincoln on the north side of the park.<br><br>
On June 5, 1856, the Washington statue was installed on a simple granite base designed by Richard Upton. The event drew thousands of spectators. One month later, on July 4, the statue was formally conveyed to the custody of the City of New York. At that time the sculpture stood in a fenced enclosure in the middle of the street, at the southeast corner of the square. As part of the redesign and reconstruction of the park in 1929-30, the sculpture was moved from this traffic island (where it was prone to vehicular traffic and pollution) to its present location and placed centrally in the south plaza. Here it was stood in alignment with Henry Kirke Brown’s sculpture of Lincoln &#8211; relocated at that time to the northern park path.<br><br>
In 1989, the sculpture was conserved, and the missing sword and bridle strap recreated through the Adopt-A-Monument program, a joint venture of Parks, the Municipal Art Society, and the New York City Art Commission. The Citywide Monuments Conservation Program, a public-private initiative, conserved the sculpture in 2001, and performed additional restoration of the bronze in 2004 and granite pedestal in 2006.<br><br>
In the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the George Washington sculpture served as a touchstone for collective grieving and public expression, and became the central focus of a massive round-the-clock community vigil and a provisional shrine. These events reaffirmed the symbolic power of New York City’s most venerable outdoor work of art.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Washington Square Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Washington Square North, New York, (On the left when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Washington Square Park is named for George Washington (1732-1799), the commander of the Continental Army, who was inaugurated in New York City as the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789.<br><br>
The parkland was once a marsh fed by Minetta Brook, located near an Indian village known as Sapokanikan or &#8220;Tobacco Field.&#8221; In 1797, the Common Council acquired the land for uses as a Potter’s Field and for public executions, giving rise to the legend of the Hangman’s Elm which stands in the northwest corner of the park.<br><br>
First used as the Washington Military Parade Ground in 1826, the site became a public park in 1827. Following this designation, a number of wealthy and prominent families, wanting to escape the disease and congestion of downtown Manhattan, moved into the area and built the distinguished Greek Revival mansions that still line the square’s north side. In 1838 the park hosted the first public demonstration of the telegraph by Samuel F.B. Morse.<br><br>
Soon after the creation of the Department of Public Parks in 1870, the square was redesigned and improved by M.A. Kellogg, Engineer-in-Chief, and I.A. Pilat, Chief Landscape Gardener. Their plan followed the principles of Frederick Law Olmsted &#8211; providing a more rustic and informal space with curvilinear paths along its periphery, retaining many of the diagonal paths within the park’s core, and defining plots of grass with shade trees. The most dramatic change was the addition of a carriage drive through the park’s interior connecting Fifth Avenue to Lower Manhattan.<br><br>
The marble Washington Arch, designed by noted architect Stanford White, was built between 1890-1892 and replaced a wooden arch erected in 1889 to commemorate the centennial of the first president’s inauguration. Statues of Washington were later installed on (sic) Arch’s north side - Washington as Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Fame and Valor (1916) by Hermon MacNeil, and Washington as President, accompanied by Wisdom and Justice (1918) by Alexander Sterling Calder.<br><br>
Other monuments in this park are John Quincy Adams Ward’s bust of steel innovator Alexander Lyman Holley (1890), Giovanni Turini’s statue of Italian-nationalist leader Giuseppe Garibaldi (1888), a World War I flagpole, and the central fountain which was moved here from Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in the mid-1870s.<br><br>
Washington Square Park was redefined socially and culturally throughout the 20th century. Following the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in 1911, labor unions marched here. &#8220;Ashcan School&#8221; artists such as John Sloan painted in the park, and the bohemian community of the late 19th and early-20th centuries congregated here. Th Beat generation of the 1940s and 50s and the &#8220;folkies&#8221; of the 1950s and early 60s also made the park their sanctuary. During this period the park became a haven for performers and protesters.<br><br>
Through these social upheavals, Fifth Avenue ran through the Arch until 1964 when the park was redesigned and closed to traffic at the insistence of vigilant Greenwich Village residents. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the lowering of the fountain and creation of a two-tiered central plaza which cemented its reputation as an ad hoc performance space. A new mounded area to the southwest became a cherished play space and chess and gaming tables at the south and northwest entryways created a vibrant culture with an international reputation.<br><br>
In the 1990s both playgrounds were upgraded, petanque courts built a &#8220;teen plaza&#8221; in the southwest park precinct, and a dog run was introduced. In 2003-04 the Washington Square Arch was restored. After an intensive analysis of the park’s historical development and a process of community input unprecedented in scope the park was rebuilt in a three-phase renovation designed by landscape architect George Vellonakis. The first phase (2009) included a renovated and accessible fountain and plaza, conservation of the Alexander Holley Monument, additional seating, expanded lawns, and new planting beds that increased the park’s green space.<br><br>
The second phase (2012) provided a small dog run, a new chess plaza, a performance stage, features BKSK Architects’ new LEED-certified park house and comfort stations, whose subtle curvature, reclaimed wood, stone palette and low profile integrate with the lush surroundings. To the southwest, the asphalt mounds were replaced by a new mounded play area submerged in a meadow and made safer and more attractive with artificial turf.<br><br>
Today Washington Square Park, rich in history, remains one of the jewels in the park system, serving as a dynamic commons for local residents, chess players, students, performers and tourists from around the globe.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[Shirley Hayes and the Preservation of Washington Square Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Washington Square North, New York, (On the left when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[In the early 1950s , the City of New York proposed running a four-lane, partially sunken broadway through the middle of Washington Square Park. In February 1952, Mrs. Shirley Hayes (1912-2002), a young mother of four sons (Dennis, Timothy, Christopher, Kerry) living in Greenwich Village, discovered the city’s plans to link Fifth Avenue &#8211; which at the time ran through the park &#8211; with West Broadway in an attempt to alleviate downtown traffic congestion. The measure, approved by the City Planning Board and then Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, would have removed the park’s fountain and allowed cars and buses to cut right through the heart of the park.<br><br>
Established as a public park in 1827, Washington Square Park is a historic open space and the home of many monuments including the marble Washington Arch, a statue of Italian nationalist leader Giuseppe Garibaldi, and an authentic World War I flagpole. Mrs. Hayes and many others believed the plan to run a new major artery through the park would compromise the historic character, of the Village and deny thousands of local residents and visitors the only large green space in their neighborhood. Pitted against opposition from City Hall, the Board of Estimate, New York University, and elected officials, Mrs. Hayes began a fight to &#8220;Save the Square&#8221; that lasted for seven years. In addition to being appointed to the Manhattan Borough President’s Greenwich Village Community Planning Board to help find an alternate plan for the park, she founded the Washington Square Park Committee, composed of 36 community groups, including property owners, civic associations, parent-teacher associations, and churches. As the leader of this effort, she was said at the time to be the &#8220;true Village Voice.&#8221; She spoke out against the city’s plan and urged the community to remember that &#8220;some provision for healthy family living and some vestige of quiet and beauty must be allowed to survive.&#8221;<br><br>
As neighborhood support for Mrs. Hayes’s campaign grew, a number of alternate plans were proposed. In 1955, Manhattan Borough President Hulan E. Jack unveiled a plan to build a depressed roadway through the park, while community leaders including Anthony Dapilito tried to negotiate with the city, suggesting alternatives including a tunnel beneath the park. Raymond S. Rubinow, Chairman of the Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square Park to Traffic, formulated a &#8220;turn-around&#8221; compromise that would allow only Fifth Avenue Coach Company buses to use a traffic lane around the Washington Arch.<br><br>
Mrs. Hayes and her community allies rejected these proposals, saying that only one alternative would &#8220;best serve the needs of children and adults of the family community.&#8221; Mrs. Hayes proposed that Washington Square Park be forever closed to all motor vehicles. Her plan, calling for one and three-fourths acres of existing roadways be transferred to parkland and a paved area to be used for emergency use only, received widespread support from community members, including then Congressman John V. Lindsay (Mayor 1966-1973) and Charles McGuiness of the Village Independent Democrats. She believed the unification of the park would create a better venue for cultural and recreational activities such as the Shakespeare Festival, outdoor concerts, and art exhibits.<br><br>
In 1958, a public hearing was held to discuss a roadway through the park. Bus loads of supporters &#8211; including Eleanor Roosevelt &#8211; a resident of 20 Washington Square Park West &#8211; crowded into City Hall to support Mrs. Hayes. With Assemblyman William F. Passannante, Manhattan Borough President Hulan E. Jack, and other community leaders in attendance, a &#8220;ribbon-tying&#8221; ceremony was held on November 1, 1958, to celebrate the start of a trial period by Traffic Commissioner T.T. Wiley to close the park to all vehicles except buses. Months later, the experiment was extended to prohibit buses from the park altogether, and after a period of evaluation, a final decision on the park was to be made. In August 1959, Mrs. Hayes and her supporters were victorious in their battle at last, and the Board of Estimate closed the park to vehicular traffic for good. Today, this sign and a unified Washington Square Park stand as a testament to Shirley Hayes and her heartfelt dedication that brought the entire Greenwich Village community in a true grassroots movement to &#8220;Save the Square.&#8221;<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[West 4th Street Courts]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Sixth Avenue, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[These courts serve as a basketball mecca not only in Manhattan, but far beyond the city lines as well. Home to &#8220;the Cage,&#8221; a smaller-than-regulation court that hosts intense pick-up basketball games, the asphalt is also the site of a popular tournament that draws players from around the world. <br><br>
The park was born out of the need to superimpose a new street system over the haphazard West Village street layout. Since its colonial beginnings, the neighborhood had evolved in an unregulated fashion from marshland to farmland and then from a rural suburb to a densely settled residential, commercial, and industrial neighborhood full of crooked streets. The revolutionary 1811 Commissioners’ Plan, which introduced the grid pattern that laid out the streets and avenues of Manhattan, had little immediate impact on Greenwich Village. Intended to provide a system for the orderly development of land between 14th Street and Washington Heights, the grid left the crooked streets of the West Village intact until the advent of the automobile necessitated smoother traffic flow through Manhattan. <br><br>
Before the 1920s this site marked the end of Sixth Avenue. After traffic became an increasing concern, city planners decided to extend Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Avenues southward, providing much-needed north-south links through the West Village and up through the west side of Manhattan. The southerly extension of Sixth Avenue was finished in advance of the completion of the Holland Tunnel, and opened traffic routes to the structure. The extension helped changed the look of the Village and created several wedge-shaped plazas in the area, including Minetta Triangle at Minetta Lane, Father Demo Square at Carmine Street, Father Fagan Square at Prince Street, and Soho Square at Spring Street. The change was especially noticeable along Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenues, after both roads were extended south of 14th Street. <br><br>
This site, bounded by Avenue of the Americas, West 3rd and West 4th Streets, was acquired by the City in the 1920s in connection with the widening of Sixth Avenue as it pushed through the neighborhood south of Houston, eventually connecting with Canal Street. The remaining land was turned over to Parks on June 8, 1934 under a permit from the Department of Transportation. The playground opened on October 14, 1935. In 1945 Sixth Avenue was renamed Avenue of the Americas at the suggestion of Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia (1882&#8211;1947) to honor Pan-American ideals and principles, and the site was formally assigned to Parks on August 27, 1953. <br><br>
Basketball has been embraced by New Yorkers since the sport’s beginnings in the 1890s, and today there are well over 100 courts in Manhattan parks alone. Known for the high quality pick-up basketball games played daily at the site, several NBA players got their start at the West 4th Street Courts. A yearly tournament at &#8220;the Cage&#8221; showcases this talent, and players come from all over the world to compete. <br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This small park is a memorial to a not-quite-gone and not-quite-forgotten water feature of Lower Manhattan. When Dutch colonists settled in Manhattan in the 1620s, they learned from local Native Americans about a small brook that was full of trout. It originated near what is now Gramercy Square, burbled its way through (mostly beneath) Greenwich Village, and emptied into the Hudson at what is now West Houston Street.<br><br> 
Local Native Americans called the stream "Mannette," which was translated as "Devil's Water." Over the years, this name was spelled and respelled and spelled again in a variety of configurations: Minnetta, Menitti, Manetta, Minetta, Mannette, and Minetto. The Dutch called the water Mintje Kill, meaning small stream. In Dutch, "min" translates as little, "tje" is a diminutive, and "kill" translates as stream. The water was also known as Bestavers Killitie, Bestevaas Kelletye, Bestavens Killitie, Bestavers Killatie, and Bestaver's Killetje. <br><br>
Several families of free African-Americans, released from slavery by the Dutch, established farms and settled along the Minetta Brook in the 1600s. With African-Americans continuing to settle here in the 18th and 19th centuries, the area became known as "Little Africa." Most of the brook has been covered over, though some Village residents can claim that it flows beneath their basements and sometimes causes flooding. In the lobby of the apartment building at 2 Fifth Avenue, there is a transparent tube that is said to contain murky water spouting up from Minetta Brook.<br><br>
Minetta Playground is located at Minetta Lane, West 3rd Street, and the Avenue of the Americas. In 1934 Board of Transportation granted the Department of Parks a permit to develop this parcel as a playground which opened the following year. In 1953 the Board of Estimate assigned the site to Parks. The northern side of park included a jungle gym, swings, a see-saw, and benches, and the area south of the open pavilion served as a sitting area, with two octagonal play houses, garden swings, and many benches. In 1996-97 the adjacent McDonalds installed new play equipment, safety surfacing, fences, and gates.<br><br>

The water was also known as Bestavers Killitie, Bestevaas Kelletye, Bestavens Killitie, Bestavers Killatie, and Bestaver's Killetje.<br><br> 
Several families of freed slaves, released by the Dutch, established farms and settled along the Minetta Brook as early as the 1640s. With African-Americans continuing to settle here in the 18th and 19th centuries, the area became known as "Little Africa." Most of the brook has been covered over, though some Village residents can claim that it flows beneath their basements and sometimes causes flooding. In the lobby of the apartment building at 2 Fifth Avenue, there is a transparent tube that is said to contain murky water spouting up from Minetta Brook. The brook's most recent claim to fame is providing the namesake for the Minetta Tavern, one of the original watering holes of the Beat generation.<br><br>
Minetta Green is located at the southeast corner of Minetta Lane and the Avenue of the Americas. In 1934 Board of Transportation granted the Department of Parks a permit to develop this parcel for recreational purposes. A playground opened on the site the following year. After the Board of Estimate assigned this parcel to Parks in 1953, it was developed as a sitting area. Privet hedges were added around the existing pin oaks, and benches were installed.<br><br>
In 1992, community members formed the Bleecker Area Merchant and Resident Association, or B.A.M.R.A. Along with the Bedford Downing Block Association, or B.D.B.A., they began the process of revitalizing Minetta Triangle and nearby Sir Winston Churchill Square and Minetta Green. With the help of Community Board #2, B.A.M.R.A. and B.D.B.A developed a successful proposal for the renovation of all three parks. In 1998 State Senator Tom Duane, who was then their council member, and Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields funded the $742,000 reconstruction of the parks.<br><br>
New trees and shrubs, along with the creation of a curvilinear bluestone path featuring images of trout, transformed the rigid geometry of Minetta Green. The garden path is punctuated by small circular sitting areas surrounding trees, world’s fair benches, boulders and fluted cast iron urns. Small mounds, built up in the interior of the path, add depth to the previously flat landscape and create more of a pastoral setting. Once predominantly concrete, the sitting areas have become green garden coves.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This small park is named for a not-quite-gone and not-quite-forgotten water feature of Lower Manhattan: Minetta Brook.<br><br>
When Dutch colonists settled in Manhattan in the 1620s, they learned from local Native Americans about a small brook that was full of trout. It originated near what is now Gramercy Park, burbled its way over and beneath Greenwich Village, and emptied into the Hudson at what is now West Houston Street. The Native Americans called the stream &#8220;Mannette,&#8221; which was translated as &#8220;Devil’s Water.&#8221; The Dutch called the water Mintje Kill, meaning small stream. <br><br>
Several families of freed slaves, released by the Dutch, established farms and homes along the Minetta Brook as early as the 1640s. With African Americans continuing to settle here in the 18th and 19th centuries, the area became known as &#8220;Little Africa.&#8221; Most of the brook has been covered over, though some Village residents claim that it flows beneath their basements and sometimes causes flooding. In the lobby of the apartment building at 2 Fifth Avenue, there is a transparent tube that is said to contain murky water spouting up from Minetta Brook.<br><br>
This triangle, located at the northeast corner of the Avenue of the Americas and Minetta Lane, is one of three nearby parks named after the feisty brook. The City of New York acquired this parcel in 1925 as part of the southerly extension of Sixth Avenue (now Avenue of the Americas) and assigned it to Parks in 1945 after deeming the .075 acre excess. In 1992, community members formed the Bleecker Area Merchant and Resident Association, or B.A.M.R.A. Along with the Bedford Downing Block Association, or B.D.B.A., they developed a successful proposal for the renovation of Minetta Triangle, Sir Winston Churchill Square, and Minetta Green.<br><br>

Building elements recall the architecture of 18th century England and the American colonies. Architect Benjamin Wistar Morris was responsible for the red brick and limestone design. The building features recessed Palladian style windows, a curved double height entrance pavilion, a heavy limestone pediment with cartouche crest, limestone quoins and Art Deco-style carved details. The building is notable among clubs of the period for its &#8220;space for ladies&#8221; and dedicated Park Avenue entrance crowned by a decorative lintel displaying four female faces.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Giuseppe Garibaldi Monument]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Washington Square East, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This monument is dedicated to General Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), the 19th century Italian patriot who crusaded for a unified Italy during the European Era of state building.<br>
Known as the &#8220;Sword of Italian Unification,&#8221; in 1834, Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the Young Italy Society organized by the nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872). They fought in the first republican uprising for independence in Genoa, Italy, but after the movement was crushed Garibaldi fled to South America where he remained in exile from 1836 to 1848. While there, he fought against Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas in the Uruguayan Civil War from 1842 to 1846.<br>
Garibaldi returned to Italy in 1849 to support Mazzini and his short-lived Roman republic. After Mazzini’s regime capitulated to French forces, Garibaldi fled Italy for New York where me met inventor and fellow Italian exile Antonio Meucci (1808-1889), whose patent for telephone technology predated Alexander Graham Bell. Meucci invited Garibaldi to stay at his cottage in Clifton, Staten Island. There, Garibaldi worked as a candlemaker as he recovered from the war and planned his nest military campaign. Today, the cottage on Tompkins Avenue is the home of the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum.<br>
In 1854, Garibaldi returned to Italy to fight for a united Italian nation. In 1860, Garibaldi’s volunteer forces seized Sicily and Naples. The successful campaign led to the unification of Italy under King Victor Emmanuel II, and solidified Garibaldi’s international reputation as a military leader. President Abraham Lincoln offered Garibaldi a command in the Union Army at the beginning of the Civil War, which Garibaldi declined so that he could continue to fight for the fledgling nation.<br>
The sculptor, Giovanni Turini (1841-1899), who also designed the bronze bust of Mazzini unveiled in Central Park in 1878, was a volunteer member of Garibaldi’s Fourth Regiment during the war between Italy and Austria in 1866. Donated by New York’s Italian-American community, the bronze statue on a granite pedestal was dedicated in 1888, the sixth anniversary of Garibaldi’s death.<br>
By the 1960s, a good-luck ritual developed among New York University Finance students in which each new student in the School of Finance tossed a penny at the base of the Garibaldi Monument at the start of the school year. Acknowledging this tradition and reinforcing its commitment to the community, the university sponsored a wreath-laying ceremony in 1961 to honor the centennial of Italy’s unification.<br>
In 1970, the Garibaldi monument was moved about 15 feet to the east to allow for construction of a promenade in Washington Square. A glass vessel containing documents from the 1880s was found under the original base of the statue. The documents included newspaper accounts of Garibaldi’s death, a history of the Committee for the Movement of Garibaldi, the organization that helped place the statue, and a poster for and news clippings about the monument’s 1888 dedication.<br>
In 1998, the monument was conserved by the City Parks Foundation Monuments Conservation program. The treatment included cleaning, repainting, and applying a protective coating to the bronze sculpture, as well as cleaning and repairing the stone pedestal. In September 2000, Garibaldi’s scabbard, vandalized and long in storage, was reinstalled and unified with his sword. The project was funded in part by the American Express Company, the Florence Gould Foundation, and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This Federal house, originally owned by Josiah Purdy, dates from 1818 and was restored in 2010. Initially a dwelling, it is an excellent example of Soho’s early period and of a building undergoing substantial changes in use and occupancy throughout its history.<br><br>
Beginning as early as 1850 the building was expanded and altered to function for commercial purposes. Its original gambrel roof, lifted to its present configuration, and the wood and glass storefront flanking a chamfered entrance were the house’s first transformations. This change reflects the transition of what was primarily a residential neighborhood into a commercial, manufacturing and retail neighborhood. Significant changes occurred to the historic brick and wood house throughout the 19th century and well into the next.<br><br>
In 2006 Croc’s Retail with ELAN General Contracting, a design/build company doing work nationwide, and architect William J. Rockwell were permitted by the owners to proceed with the latest transformation, that retains the overall historic building’s shape materially and adds a glass addition revealing more of the original house’s north elevation.<br><br>
The face bricks on the Spring Street façade demonstrate the numerous alterations the building has endured. More than half of the restored façade uses original face bricks, which were recycled as they were in several previous reconstructions occurring between the Civil War and the mid twentieth century.<br><br>
The contrast of the new and old bricks tells a particular story of the neighborhood and how buildings endure reassembled and restored. The vision and commitment of Crocs Retail throughout the four year restoration process have preserved this historic building for the people of New York.<br><br>

You won’t be alone when you sit outside lunching on your sushi or salad bar delights.<br>
Not with the likes of Thelonious Monk, Jackson Pollock or Edgar Allen Poe poised just a few feet away!<br><br>
Commissioned by MortonWilliams Supermarket, this spectacular acrylic on canvas mural titled &#8220;Bohemorama&#8221; was designed and executed by neighborhood resident Vicki Khuzami. No stranger to the art world, during the last 15 years Khuzami has painted over 50 murals, from the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington D.C., to Tibet House and the Botanical Gardens here in New York, and several in Japan, including Disneyland, Tokyo.<br><br>
Bohemorama is divided into three sections: one featuring writers, another, artists, and the third, musicians. Defying chronology but not geography, Khuzami has chosen to depict her subjects in most cases, prior to their notoriety and success, focusing instead on their connections to each other’s work, and the environment of Greenwich Village. They were all artistic geniuses, many grappling with addictions, poverty and homosexuality forced into the closet by an uncompromising society. Greenwich Village was the only place they could live the lived they needed to live.<br><br>
See Albee clutching a glass of wine? (Remember the alcoholic protagonist of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?) Notice the drinks, cigarettes and marijuana joint on the table. Can you spot a young Ginsberg, looking admiringly at Jack Kerouac whose work Ginsberg later promoted? Look carefully and you will see Kerouac’s words: &#8220;<i>The mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.&#8221;</i><br><br>
Move on to the artists panel. There is John Sloan, holdover from the School or Realism, with his hand on his chin, surrounded by artistic expressionists. See Willem deKooning and his wife Elaine? Behind them is Edie Sedgwick, artistic muse for Andy Warhol, who is holding polaroid portraits of people he will immortalize in his works. Behind him is Jackson Pollock, holding a bottle of beer, and Lee Krasner, his long suffering artistic wife. The splatters of paint on his T-shirt reflect his artistic style. They’re sitting with intellectual surrealist Marcel Duchamp who is challenging Pollack to play a game of chess. (What’s Greenwich Village without a chess game?)<br><br>
Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk sit with instruments and sheet music, working out a tune. Billie Holiday is there too, looking warmly at Woodie Guthrie, lipstick on her wineglass. Poet and musician Patti Smith sits beside her, with an arm on Holiday’s shoulder. See her &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; button (an anachronistic touch); in front of her, she is jotting down the words to her song &#8220;Power to the People.&#8221; Next to Patti is Joan Baez. Bob Dylan, guitar in hand, looks up at his idol and our folk hero Woodie Guthrie, eyes cast upward, searching for words to a new song.<br><br>
<i>&#8221;Of all the murals I have ever done, &#8220;Bohemorama&#8221; is a favorite, since the subject matter was infinitely inspiring, especially during these times of excess when the importance of the ‘bohemian’ artist’s contributions to society appears to be in question&#8221;</i> says Khuzami. <i>&#8220;I have tried to express the creativity, struggle and overcoming of obstacles that are the common bond for these renegades who were trailblazers for so many others.&#8221;</i>]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On LaGuardia Place, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Unveiled in 1994, this dynamic statue of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia (1882-1947) is by the well-known sculptor Neil Estern (b. 1926). La Guardia, the son of a United States Army bandleader, was born on December 11, 1882, at 177 Sullivan Street in Manhattan’s Little Italy.<br><br>
He received his law degree from New York University, was admitted to the Bar in 1910, and became the nation’s first Italian-American Congressman in 1916. La Guardia held various congressional posts until 1932, and served as president of New York City’s Board of Aldermen from 1920 to 1921.<br><br>
In 1933, La Guardia, then nicknamed &#8220;Little Flower&#8221;, (translation of &#8220;fiorello&#8221;) was elected mayor on a reform Fusion ticket following the scandals that had forced Mayor James J. (&#8220;Beau James&#8221;) Walker (1881-1946) from office. He was inaugurated on New Year’s Day 1934. Over the next 12 years, La Guardia left his distinctive mark on City politics. He united the public transit system, consolidated and centralized much of City government, cracked down on illegal gambling, and constructed numerous bridges, parks, and airports. He appointed Robert Moses (1881-1981), (sic) the first commissioner of a unified Parks Department in 1934, and embarked on an unprecedented expansion of the New York City parks system throughout the 1930s and early 1040s. During his third term, 1942 to 1945, Gracie Mansion became the official residence of New York City’s mayors.<br><br>
La Guardia also served as Director of the U.S. Office of Civilian Defense from 1941 to 1942. Shortly after leaving office in 1945, La Guardia became Director General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. La Guardia is remembered for his passionate leadership in defense of social causes. He died on September 20, 1947.<br><br>
In the early 1990s, the Friends of La Guardia Place raised funds to renovate the barren public plazas along the east side of the street. The buildings along this stretch had been razed decades earlier to make way for the never built Fifth Avenue South connector to the unrealized Lower Manhattan Expressway. As part of these landscape improvements, the Friends commissioned this sculpture of La Guardia for the neighborhood in which he was raised.<br><br>
Having considered the designs of several artists, The monument committee selected Neil Estern’s active full-figure representation, in which La Guardia is shown gesticulating in mid-stride, with his mouth wide open in speech. Brooklyn-based sculptor Estern, formerly president of the National Sculpture Society, also created the statue of John F. Kennedy in Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, as well as a sculpture of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and their dog, Fala, at the FDR memorial in Washington, D.C.<br><br>
On October 19, 1994, the La Guardia sculpture was formally dedicated in a ceremony presided over by Al McGrath, the late president of the Friends of La Guardia Place. participants included L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University, and four mayors, Abraham D. Beame (served 1974-1977), Edward I. Koch (served 1978-1989), David N. Dinkins (served 1990-1993), and Mayor Giuliani (served 1994-2001).<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Mercer Street, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Mercer Playground is one of New York’s youngest parks, located in one of its oldest areas, Greenwich Village. Mercer Street, directly to the east of the park, was laid out prior to 1797 and called First Street and Clermont Street. By 1799 it was renamed for physician and soldier Hugh Mercer (c. 1720-1777). Born in Scotland, Mercer emigrated to America in 1747 and settled in Pennsylvania. His military service included fighting in the French and Indian War of 1755 and organizing and drilling the Virginia militia and the Minutemen in 1775-76. Appointed brigadier-general (sic) in June 1776, Mercer advised General George Washington to march on Princeton and commanded the advance. Mercer died of wounds he suffered during the Battle of Princeton, and his funeral in Philadelphia was attended by a crowd of 30,000.<br><br>
This part of Greenwich Village has a long modern history dating back to the 17th century and the original Dutch colonists. Wouter Van Twiller, Director-General of New Netherland once owned the land in this part of Manhattan, and towards the end of the 18th century several families of freed slaves, (sic) established farms and homes in what eventually became known as &#8220;Little Africa.&#8221; In the early 1820s the intersection of Mercer and Bleeker Streets, just across the street from Mercer Playground, served as one of the sites of what could be the earliest African-American theatre company, the African Theater, also known as the African Grove. Headed by the West Indian William Henry Brown, the African Grove launched the career of Ira Aldridge, who went on to play the role of Othello at the Royal Theatre in London, and gave James Hewett the opportunity to play Shakespeare’s Richard III for a mixed audience of blacks and whites.<br><br>
The area continued to grow as Manhattan grew, and Washington Square became home to the city’s affluent by the end of the 19th century. By the 20th century, the area was home to a thriving Italian and Irish immigrant population. This area of Greenwich Village was once occupied by mixed-use buildings like those south of Houston Street, but the area was transformed in the 1950s when Parks Commissioner Robert Moses helped secure federal funds for slum clearance, leading to the development of the adjacent Washington Square Village. Mercer Playground itself was originally owned by the Department of Transportation in anticipation of a project to widen Mercer Street. That plan was prevented by neighborhood objections and the site remained vacant for four decades, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation. In 1991 the Lower Manhattan Neighbors’ Organization Inc., known by the acronym LMNO(P) at a total cost of $340,000. LMNO(P) raised an additional $100,000 for the construction of the fence. Supporters included New York University, the Robinson and Benham Charitable Trust, and the Archives Fund.<br><br>
Architect William Wormser, an LMNO(P) member, developed the design concept, which provides play spaces for pre-teens. Features include a long snaked path for in-line and roller skating, a large paved path for running games and bicycling, climbing structures, and a spray shower. A decorative wrought-iron fence, adorned with spiral and silhouettes of familiar objects, unites the three sections of Mercer Playground. The community can be justifiably proud in knowing that, together, they made their own backyard.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On LaGuardia Place, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Landscape artist Alan Sonfist (1946-) created Time Landscape as a living monument to the forest that once blanketed Manhattan Island. He proposed the project in 1965. After extensive research on New York’s botany, geology, and history Sonfist and local community members used a palette of native trees, shrubs, wild grasses, flowers, plants, rocks and earth to plant the 25’ x 40’ rectangular plot at the northeast corner of LaGuardia Place and West Houston Street in 1978. The result of their efforts is a slowly developing forest that represents the Manhattan landscape inhabited by Native Americans and encountered by Dutch settlers ibn the early 17th century.<br><br>
The surrounding neighborhood, now known as Greenwich Village, was once a marshland dotted with sandy hills that the Canarsie Indians called the Sapokanican and that the Dutch called the Zantberg. The trout-filled Minetta Brook ran to the west and made the area a favorite spot for fishing and duck hunting. Over the course of three-and-a-half centuries, agricultural, residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial development replaced the natural marshland with an urban landscape. While numerous manmade features ( such as buildings and streets) preserve the history of 18th-, 19th, and 20th-century Greenwich Village, Time Landscape serves as a natural landmark of the 17th and prior centuries. This forested plot invites city-dwellers - including insects, birds, people, and other animals - to experience a bygone Manhattan.<br><br>
When it was first planned, Time Landscape portrayed the three stages of forest growth from grasses to saplings to grown trees. The southern part of the plot represented the youngest stage and now has birch trees and beaked hazelnut shrubs, with a layer of wildflowers beneath. The center features a small grove of beech trees (grown from saplings transplanted from Sonfist’s favorite childhood park in the Bronx) and a woodland with red cedar, black cherry, and witch hazel above groundcover of mugwort, Virginia creeper, aster, pokeweed, and milkweed. The northern area is a mature woodland dominated by oaks, with scattered white ash and American elm trees. Among the numerous other species in this miniforest are oak, sassafras, sweetgum, and tulip trees, arrowwood and dogwood shrubs, bindweed and catbrier vines, and violets.<br><br>
Time Landscape is on city-owned land, assigned to Transportation. It is maintained by Parks under Greenstreets, a program inaugurated in 1986 and reintroduced in 1994 to convert paved street properties, like triangles and malls, into green lawns. Funded through Parks and Recreation’s capital budget, Greenstreets plants trees and shrubs in the city’s barren street spaces. The assistance of volunteers keeps these areas clean and their plants healthy.<br><br>

‘A good puzzle would be to cross Ireland without passing a pub.’ <i>Ulysses</i><br>
James Joyce identified and described the characteristic ambience of the Irish pub so successfully that the characters in <i>Ulysses</i> may be fictional, but they were based on a multitude of living beings, characters who Joyce found in pubs just like this one.<br>
This establishment remains an outstanding example of the tradition which Joyce immortalized in his works and is an authentic Irish pub which retains a genuineness of atmosphere, friendliness and presence of good company.<br>

    <name><![CDATA[Peter Cooper Park]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On 3rd Avenue, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[For more than a century, Peter Cooper (1791-1883) &#8211; philanthropist, industrialist and inventor &#8211; has watched over the park and school that bear his name. Cooper was a native New Yorker and workingman’s son with less than a year of formal schooling, who became one of the most successful American businessmen of his day. He made his fortune in iron, glue, railroads, real estate and communications. His inventions include the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable and Tom Thumb, America’s first functioning steam engine. Cooper also invented Jello &#8211; with help from his wife, Sarah, who added fruit to his clarified gelatin.<br><br>
Despite his many successful ventures, Cooper failed in his bid for the presidency in 1876. Representing the Greenback party, he captured 81,737 popular votes. The real contest, however, Was between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Jones Tilden. Although Tilden won a majority of the popular vote, he lost the electoral college vote, 185 to 184, to Hayes in an election that was widely regarded as being stolen by the Republicans.<br><br>
Cooper dedicated his life and wealth to philanthropy, to ensure that immigrants and children of the working class would have access to the education which he never had. Believing that education should be As (sic) free as water or air, in 1859 he established the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a coeducational college which continues to provide students with full-tuition scholarships in architecture, art, and engineering. Celebrated features of the institution included a free reading room and the Great Hall. The latter provided the setting for one of Abraham Lincoln’s most important speeches in which he established his anti-slavery platform. He delivered it on February 27, 1860 during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.<br><br>
Following Cooper’s death in 1863, Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907), the preeminent 19th century sculptor and one of the earliest alumni of Cooper Union (class of 1864), was commissioned to design a monument in honor of the great visionary. St. Gaudens collaborated with the renowned architect Stanford White (1853-1906) who created the marble and granite canopy. The official dedication took place on May 29, 1897 at the northern end of Cooper Park.<br><br>
The park was deeded to the city in 1828 for uses as a public space by Charles H. Hall, a descendant of Governor Peter Stuyvesant. Named Stuyvesant Square at the time it was acquired by Parks in 1850, it was referred to as Fourth Avenue Park when it was first planted in the late 1870s, and renamed Cooper Park in 1883. In the early 1900s, the park was redesigned, reconstructing the original walks, enclosing the park with an iron fence, and redesigning the stone periphery to form a continuous seat (this has since been eliminated). The reconstruction of the park in 1938 included destroying the underground comfort station and laying new walks.<br><br>
More recent improvements have focused on making the park more beautiful and more accessible. The monument was restored in 1987 under the Adopt-a-Monument program, a joint project of the Municipal Art Society, the Art Commission, and Parks & Recreation. In February 1999, Commissioner Stern and Cooper Union President John Jay Iselin celebrated the 140th anniversary of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, commemorating the legacy of Peter Cooper. As of the summer on 1999, new benches and daytime access have opened Cooper Square to all of its neighbors.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Park Avenue, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The Lever House was designed by Gordon Bunshaft for the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and completed in 1952. It was built as the international headquarters for Lever Brothers Company, a manufacturer of commercial soaps and detergents.<br><br>
The New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Lever House as an official landmark in 1982, observing a requirement that a building must have existed for 30 years. The landmark designation of November 9, 1982 stated: &#8220;Lever House has a special character, special historical and aesthetic interest and value as part of the development, heritage, and cultural characteristic of New York City….it is among the first, as well as the most famous, corporate expressions of the Modern International style in postwar America….is widely recognized as a key monument in the evolution of the International Style and has assumed an important role in the literature of modern architecture, and that lever House remains outstanding for its spatial clarity, scale, and beauty of form.&#8221;<br><br>
The building was purchased in 1998 by RFR Holding LLC who began a capital improvement program to restore the building’s distinctive curtain wall, stainless steel mullions, and public spaces. The renovation project included the addition of marble benches designed by sculptor Isamu Noguchi for the building’s plazas, which were elements in Bunshaft’s original 1952 plans for Lever House but were never realized.<br><br>
Since the completion of the Lever House renovation, the building’s outdoor plaza and glass-enclosed lobby have been used as an exhibition area for the ambitious and contemporary Lever House Art Collection. This program commissions artists to create works specifically for the Lever House space, responding to the architecture, atmosphere, street, and pedestrian traffic in innovative ways. The artworks are then purchased for the collection.<br><br>
In recent years, an exciting and diverse number of paintings, sculptures, and light installations have been featured. The purpose of the Lever House Art Collection is to form an inventive and impressive collection of art created in the early twenty-first century that recognizes outstanding artists of aesthetic significance, and simultaneously enhances the artistic environment of New York City.]]></desc>

    <name><![CDATA[New York City AIDS Memorial]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Greenwich Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The NYC AIDS Memorial honors more than 100,000 New Yorkers who died of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). It also recognizes the contributions of caregivers and activists who mobilized to provide care for the ill, fight discrimination, lobby for medical research, and alter the drug approval process, effectively changing the trajectory of the epidemic. The memorial aims to inspire and empower current and future activists, health professionals, and people living with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) in the continuing mission to eradicate the disease.<br><br>
The Memorial sits on a triangular site that was most recently part of the former St. Vincent’s Hospital campus. Following the closing of the hospital in 2010, a public park was designed for the site through a community review process. The new park was constructed by the Rudin Management Company as part of the conversion of the hospital into a residential development and given to the City of New York in 2017.<br><br>
This park was selected as the site for the AIDS Memorial because it sits at a unique crossroads in early AIDS history in New York City. The earliest documented AIDS cases, first reported in 1981, disproportionately affected the gay male population, which had large communities in the surrounding West Village and Chelsea neighborhoods. As a result of the number of ill patients filling the beds and hallways of the hospital, in 1984 St. Vincent’s established the first AIDS ward in the city and the second in the nation. The Memorial site is less than a block from the LGBT Community Center on 13th Street, where ACT-UP (the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) and other AIDS advocacy and support groups first organized. It is also within blocks of the first headquarters of Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC), and the former office of Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, who pioneered community-based research trials for AIDS drugs. His co-op board’s attempt to evict him led to the nation’s first AIDS anti-discrimination case in 1983. Many consider the Memorial’s location as the symbolic epicenter of the epidemic and the mobilization against it.<br><br>
The memorial’s white triangular steel sculpture, central fountain, and benches were designed by studio ai architects, selected through an international design competition. Renowned visual artist Jenny Holzer chose and arranged passages from &#8220;Song of Myself&#8221; (1855), poet Walt Whitman’s transcendent celebration of hope, unity, and human dignity, which are engraved in the memorial’s granite pavement. The memorial is a place of contemplation and provides a shelter for reflection and remembrance of the men, women, and children lost to AIDS. It also serves as a gathering place and reminder of the work that remains to defeat the disease. The memorial was dedicated on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2016.<br><br>
The NYC AIDS memorial organization is a 501(c)(3) corporation that developed the memorial and supports the ongoing maintenance and educational programming for the space. For more information and to support this endeavor, please visit nycaidsmemorial.org.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Erected as Seagram’s corporate headquarters in 1956-58, to coincide with the company’s 1957 centennial, the Seagram Building is the only building in New York City designed by the renowned architect Mies van der Rohe. A key monument of 20th Century architecture, it deliberately broke ranks with the continuous masonry corridor of Park Avenue to embody the ideal of a tower in a plaza. Mies relied on the quality of scale, proportions, and materials, rather than on the application of ornamental detail, to achieve the building’s remarkable austere elegance. The floating transparency of its glass curtain wall, balanced against the strength of its exterior bronze members, gives aesthetic expression to the modern skyscraper’s steel-cage structure. Plaza, tower, and interior spaces are integrated by meticulous detailing and carefully chosen material, including Roman travertine for the elevator core and Swenson pink granite for the plaza. Behind the tower, a six-story pavilion houses the Four Seasons Restaurant, which is separately designated as a New York City Interior Landmark.<br><br>

Instead, our backyard archaeological
dig found 97 Orchard Street's original toilet: an outdoor privy with multiple seats. Rather than a privy pit, this backyard outhouse had an underground 'vault' that drained into the public sewer under Orchard Street. It could be flushed occasionally with rainwater, or perhaps with water from a nearby spigot.<br><br>
Although exceeding City requirements at first, this shared privy remained the only sanitation for the building's twenty apartments from 1864 to 1905, when two toilets were installed in the hallway

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Sixth Avenue, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Father Antonio Demo (1870-1936) was born on April 23, 1870, at Lazzaretto di Bassano in the province of Vicenza, Italy. His study at the diocesan and Scalabrinian seminaries was twice interrupted by mandatory military service. Father Demo immigrated to Boston to do missionary work in 1896 and arrived in New York to serve as assistant pastor of Our Lady of Pompei a few years later. In 1900 he was appointed pastor of the church, whose magnificent Italianate building stands northwest of the park at the corner of Bleecker and Carmine Streets.<br><br> 
As pastor, Father Demo was respected for his excellent organizational skills: record-keeping, establishing church groups, working with local charities, and raising funds. Under his leadership, Pompei expanded its liturgical music programs, opened a day care center, and held its first bazaar. In addition to serving as a spiritual counselor to his parishioners, Father Demo was active in social services - translating documents and conversations, finding jobs, making loans, aiding in the immigration process, and writing personal recommendations. His spiritual care was exemplified by his hard work and generosity of spirit in response to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire, which claimed the lives of 146 female employees on March 25, 1911.<br><br> 
In 1923 Father Demo learned that Sixth Avenue (now the Avenue of the Americas) was to be extended from West 3rd Street south to Canal Street to route traffic to the trans-Hudson River Holland Tunnel then under construction. Our Lady of Pompei’s building stood in the middle of the proposed street bed of Sixth Avenue. Father Demo organized the campaign to buy another property and to build a new church, rectory, and parochial school. Under the direction of general contractor and architect Matthew Del Gaudio, the cornerstone of the new building was laid on October 3, 1926, and the church was dedicated two years later, on October 7, 1928.<br><br>
In 1935 Father Demo became Pompei’s pastor emeritus and superintendent of its parochial school. He died in 1936 in New York, and thousands of parishioners and friends, including Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, paid their respects to their beloved pastor. In 1941 the public plaza southeast of Our Lady of Pompei was improved by the Manhattan Borough President and named in memory of Father Demo by local law. Attended by numerous Greenwich Village, Italian, and parish groups, the dedication ceremony included the singing of the national anthem, speeches by city authorities, a parade to Washington Square Park, and a memorial Mass at Pompei.<br><br>
Fifty years after the cornerstone of the church building was laid, parishioners arranged for an inscription to be engraved on the base of the central lightpole in Father Demo Square. The site is assigned to Transportation and maintained by Parks. As in traditional town plans in Italy, Father Demo Square is a piazza - an open space surrounded by buildings and a gathering place for its community. <br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Sir Winston Churchill Square]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Sixth Avenue, New York, (On the left when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This garden and sitting area borders Downing Street and the west side of Sixth Avenue. It was named by Parks in honor of British Prime Minister Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (1874-1965), whose official residence, located at 10 Downing Street in London, shares the name of one of the streets bordering this square. Churchill’s speeches from his official residence at London’s 10 Downing Street inspired the world during some of the twentieth century’s darkest hours during World War II. He is one of only three people made an honorary citizen of the United States by Congress. The others are Raoul Wallenberg and the Marquis de Lafayette. <br><br>
Sir Winston Churchill’s career as an author, journalist, painter, politician and statesman spanned the late nineteenth century and a good deal of the twentieth century. Born on November 30, 1874, Churchill was the eldest son of Lord Randolph and Lady Jeannette Churchill. His mother, formerly Jeanette Jerome (1854-1921) was a New Yorker, a fact of which Winston was deeply proud. After graduating from the Royal Military College, Churchill was commissioned into the Royal Army in 1894. Five years later, as a war correspondent in the Boer War, he was captured. Following his subsequent escape, Churchill became a national hero, a role he would cultivate for the next sixty years through ceaseless, extraordinary service in the British government. <br><br>
Churchill is best known for his role as Prime Minister of England during World War II. Always wary of the Nazi power, he refused to make peace until Hitler was defeated, a decision which proved instrumental to the ultimate Allied victory. His fortitude and wisdom in the War incidentally earned him the ultimate New York City honor, a ticker-tape parade up Broadway in 1946. That same year, on a visit to Fulton, Missouri, Churchill coined the phrase &#8220;Iron Curtain&#8221; in reference to the Soviet Union’s expansionist tendencies.<br><br>
In 1953, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his writing and oratory, and in 1963, he was declared an honorary U.S. citizen by an Act of Congress. Although he refused a peerage, his wife, Clementine Ogilvy Hozier, whom he married in 1908, accepted one in 1965 for her public service. A member of parliament until the year before his death, Churchill will forever hold a place in annals of twentieth century history, for his vitality, imagination, boldness, and most of all, his ability to lead the world into peace.<br><br>
Parks purchased this .05-acre parcel in 1943. The sitting area, designed by George Vellonakis, was rebuilt from 1998 to 1999 to incorporate garden spaces, a pedestal mounted armillary and a decorative, gated iron fence. The Bedford Downing Block Association continues to be an important force behind the maintenance and upkeep of Churchill Square, ensuring that it remains the peaceful oasis that it is now for years to come.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Downing Street Playground]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Carmine Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
This West Village playground, located on Downing Street and Avenue of the Americas, is named for the street that runs to its south. Downing Street was laid out in 1799 and named no later than 1803, when it first appeared on a New York City map. The origin of its name is unclear. Some credit it to Thomas Downing (1791-1866), an African-American freeman who moved to New York from Virginia in 1819 and made a career selling oysters. Located at 5 Broad Street, Downing’s Oyster House was popular with leading politicians, businessmen, and celebrities. Intriguing as this association is, however, it appears to be no more than a coincidence, for Thomas Downing arrived in New York City about twenty years after the street was named.<br><br>
The Downing referred to in the street name is more likely Sir George Downing (ca. 1623-1684), a distinguished diplomat who was also the namesake of London’s Downing Street. An English native, Sir George was one of the nine graduates at Harvard College’s first commencement in 1642. After Downing played a dramatic role during the English Civil War, King Charles II knighted him Sir George and appointed him to The Hague as an ambassador. Sir George may have been influential in the negotiations between Britain and the Netherlands that gave New Orange (now New York) to the British in exchange for Surinam in 1674.<br><br>
Legend has it that this land was once the property of Aaron Burr (1756-1836), third Vice President of the United States, and the man who killed Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel. The city acquired the original 0.173-acre parcel of land between Downing and Carmine Streets by condemnation in 1896 for use as a school playground. The site was assigned to NYC Parks in 1924 and developed as a children’s playground with slides, seesaws, flagpole, and a portable shower in the mid-1930s. <br><br>
A series of renovations from 1982 to 1987 provided updated play equipment, a sprinkler shower, swings, a sandbox, and tire swings, as well as the new gate surrounding the playground. London planetrees (sic) (<i>Plantanus x acerifolia</i>), a species known for its ability to thrive in harsh urban environments, line the playground and provide welcome shade.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Carmine Street Mural]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[On Clarkson Street, New York, (On the left when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This mural was painted in August 1987 by famed graffiti artist Keith Haring (1958-1990) on the wall that adjoins the Carmine Street Pool at the James J. Walker Park handball court. Measuring 18 feet high by 170 feet long and taking its cue from the hues of the pool’s underwater shapes, the mural depicts bold, stylized motifs of fish and children as well as abstract shapes in black, yellow and blue.<br><br>
Keith Haring was born on May 4, 1958 in Reading and grew up in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. His first one-man show was at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts in 1978. He moved to New York City that year to study at the School of Visual Arts. In the early 1980s, the young artist first attained notoriety by using methods of graffiti to literally make his mark on the city. Creating a style that would soon become renowned worldwide, Haring &#8220;tagged&#8221; chalk outlines of buoyant, interlocking bodies on the black poster mounts of New York City subway stations. His vocabulary of images, such as the radiant child and barking dog, soon became instantly recognizable.<br><br>
Haring went on to have numerous exhibitions of his work and was represented by such well-known dealers as Tony Shafrizi, Andre Emmerich, and Leo Castelli. He was prolific in his artwork, generous in support of social causes, and went on to help choreograph music videos and produce coloring books to finance his charitable causes, such as Learning through Art and Doing Art Together, two programs that bought art to schools. He provided funds for numerous children’s organizations, supported efforts to oppose apartheid, and donated designs and funds to advance the cause of AIDS research.<br><br>
In 1986, Haring painted the unauthorized but much appreciated Crack is Whack mural at a playground located at the F.D.R. Drive and East 128th Street. In the same year, two of his sculptures, one untitled and the other dubbed Blue Curling Dog, were displayed temporarily at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza in Manhattan. The sculptures were also displayed in Riverside Park in 1988.<br><br>
Keith Haring died of AIDS on February 16, 1990. Not yet 32 years old, he left a legacy of art that was both popular and critically acclaimed. A foundation in his memory was established which continues to support the organizations he championed during his lifetime. In 1991-92, Haring’s Balancing the Dog was displayed at Dante Park and in 1997 the Public Art Fund, in collaboration with the Estate of Keith Haring, organized a multi-site installation of his outdoor sculptures at Central Park’s Doris Freedman Plaza and along the Park Avenue Malls. This public exhibition occurred simultaneously with a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art.<br><br>
In the spring of 1995, the Keith Haring Foundation assisted in the preservation of the Carmine Street Mural so it could continue to enliven the experience of patrons to this 1930s outdoors pool.<br><br>

The original appearance of this row of three-story Italianate town houses, now greatly altered, is perhaps best seen at No. 42. Nos. 44 & 46 were altered very extensively in 1929 to house Greenwich House Music School. This row of houses serves as a reminder of the sober design and good workmanship of many of the forgotten builders of the mid-Nineteenth Century. These new dwellings of 1851 replaced a row of shops, factories, and stables formerly owned by Timothy Whittemore, President of the Greenwich Insurance Company, whose family owned a great deal of property in the Village.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>In 1834, Greenwich Village’s shortest street was cut out of Newgate Prison to form a market square with Christopher St. and what is W. 10th St. today. This Weehawken market flourished briefly; it was shut down in 1844, supplanted by the Jefferson Market, located at what is now Christopher Street and the Avenue of the Americas.<br><br>
By 1849, private owners had taken over Weehawken Street.<br><br>
One of these owners was George F. Munson, a builder of boats. His wood-frame house, #6 Weehawken (now known as 392 West Street) with its remarkable external staircase, is the only one of the original houses still standing.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Weehawken Street Historic District is a picturesque enclave of 14 buildings dating from 1830 to 1938 that illustrate the area’s long history as a place of dwelling, industry, and commerce, much of it maritime-related. The neighborhood began to develop after the closure of the Newgate State Prison in 1829, when buildings like the Federal-style house at 398 West Street and the stable at 7 Weehawken were erected. In 1834, the City established a public Greenwich (or &#8220;Weehawken&#8221;) Market on the block bounded by West, Christopher, Amos (later West 10th Street), and Weehawken Streets. No. 392-93 West Street is a unique extant portion of the market, originally a wood-framed shed enclosed in the late 1840s after the market closed. Following the Civil War, this section of West Street became one of the busiest on the Greenwich Village waterfront. Increased mercantile activity led to the construction of tenement buildings such as Holland Hotel at 396-97 West Street. Many early 20th century artists, writers, and photographers were drawn to the area’s picturesque qualities, and by the late 1920s some buildings had been converted to middle-class apartments.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>The Building’s History</b>
<br>The site of the building had been part of the property of wealthy merchant Abraham Van Nest, which included a 4-story house on the corner and a 2-story house next door, sold in 1865 after his death. The property was acquired inn1972 by Charles Shultz, than a brick manufactured at &#8220;the foot of&#8221; West 11th Street, who resided at 621 Greenwich Avenue (by 1875, Shultz was a merchant on West 30th Street). This tenement building, constructed in 1873 to the design of William E. Waring, originally houses eight families and a store. Shultz retained the building until 1890, after which it was owned by Catherine and Ellen C. Atfield and members of the Sweeney family. In 1896, the ground story contained the saloon known as &#8220;The Plug Hat,&#8221; &#8220;On account of the schooners of beer set up holding nearly as much as could be put in a tall hat,&#8221; according to <i>The New York Times.</i><br><br>
After a partition sale, the property was transferred in 1898 to Patrick Skelly, a prominent and wealthy Irish-born brewer and distiller. In 1876, Skelly and another brewer-distiller, Patrick A. Fogarty, had purchased as Astor family residence at 409-411 West 14th Street, which they altered and expanded into an ale brewery/flats building (1875, John B. Snook). This appears on an 1879 map as [Hugh] O’Reilly, Skelly & Fogarty’s Centennial Brewery (today it is located within the Gansevoort Market Historic District). By 1899, O’Reilly, Skelly & Fogarty were experiencing financial difficulty and their properties were sold at public auction in 1901. Skelly was also founder of the Kips Bay Brewery, and he and his son operated a wine and liquor business at 21-25 Ninth Avenue (also within the Gansevoort market Historic District) from 1886 until the 1910s. Skelly’s estate was worth nearly $1.8 million at the time of his death (c.1908), more (sic) and consisted mostly of real estate, including many saloons. He left trusts of $250,000 each to his daughters Genevieve and Emily.<br><br>
The Skelly family retained No. 304 West 10th Street until 1948. One tenant (c. 1922-29) was Walter G. Kauff, a clerk at the U.S. Customshouse. The Weehawken Bar & Grill was the ground-story commercial occupant from at least 1935 to 1960. Rose Rivers purchased the property in 1948, &#8220;intending to remodel the building into modern apartments,&#8221; and filed plans by architect Joseph Lau. It was foreclosed in 1956 and reverted to the estate of Genevieve C. Skelly McLouchlin (who died in 1956) and Emily H. Skelly Walsh. The Skelly heirs auctioned the building in 1957, at which time the &#8220;upper floors [were] closed,&#8221; according to the advertisement. In 1961, the ground story was converted to two apartments and a laundry room; the building housed three apartments per floor above this. the ground story facades were remodeled.<br><br>
Built during the second significant phase of the historic district’s development, when it continued to be improved with residential and industrial structures in the late 19th century, this handsome Italianate style tenement and store building. still substantially intact, contributes to the historically-mixed architectural character and varied uses &#8211; much of it maritime-related &#8211; of the Weehawken Street Historic District.<br><br>
<b>Architectural Features</b><br>
The building is clad in brick (now painted), with cast-iron segmental lintels and decorative sills, a segmental cast-iron entrance hood on the West 10th Street façade, and a surviving cast-iron pilaster on the ground story at the south end of the Weehawken Street façade. It features a prominent bracketed, denticulated, and modified pressed metal cornice that has a bowed section on each façade with decorative panels. To the east of the east end of the West 10th Street façade, there is an entrance to the side yard, with a segmental-arched brick enframement with cast-iron keystone and end blocks, corbeled cornice, and decorative iron gates. The visible eastern wall is pierced by windows. There are fire escapes on both major facades.]]></desc>

The Stonecutters Riot was a response to the University Council’s decision to source stone for the Original University Building in 1833 from Sing Sing, where it was prepared by prisoners. After petitioning to no avail, local stonecutters and marble workers formed a mob and stormed after building contractors. The City called the National Guard to put down the riot, which took three days. The memorial represents how this labor action is ingrained in the history of NYU.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Washington Square South, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>On September 12, 1609, Henry Hudson first laid eyes on the island named <i>Manhatta</i> by its local residents, the Lenape people. Since then, Manhattan has developed into one of the world’s most altered landscapes. Today, there is little remaining of the forests, grasslands, and streams that once combined to form a uniquely varied ecosystem on the island.<br><br>
Coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Henry Hudson, the Woodland Garden features a variety of plant species likely to have been present on the day Henry Hudson first sailed by the island. The design brings a microcosmic and stylized version of botanical diversity and aesthetic character of a native Manhattan woodland into a highly urban environment.<br><br>
The NYU Native Woodland Garden was funded by a gift from the NYU Class of 2008 in association with the NYU Garden Shop, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Manhatta Project, and the Henry Hudson 400 Foundation.<br><br>
The garden was designed by Darrel Morrison, fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects and Professor and Dean Emeritus of the School of Environmental Design at the University of Georgia. Morrison is a specialist in ecologically-based landscape design and management. He is recipient of the 2006 Landscape Designer Award of the American Horticultural Society.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On 6th Avenue, New York, (In the median)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[The statue of the Uruguayan independence leader and national hero, General José Artigas (1764-1850), is one of a pantheon of six sculptures to Latin American leaders which overlook the Avenue of the Americas. They include Juan Pablo Duarte (1813-1876), considered the Father of the Dominican Republic, at Canal Street, and Brazilian independence leader José Bonidacio de Andrada e Silva (1763-1838) in Bryant Park at 41st Street. Located on the Avenue at Central Park South are statues of the Cuban patriot, journalist, and poet, José Martí (1853-1895), Argentine General José de San Martín (1778-1850), and South American liberator Simón Bolívar (1783-1830). <br><br>
José Artigas was born on June 19, 1764 on the outskirts of Montevideo, then part of the Banda Oriental del Uruguay, in the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. Artigas’ parents were criollos, and his family were landowners; it was on their estates that at a young age he earned the respect and admiration of the gauchos for his courage and strong character. In 1797 he became military commander of the Cuerpo de Blandengues, a Spanish force charged with ridding the country of outlaws and smugglers. During the British invasions in 1805 and 1807, Artigas distinguished himself in the unsuccessful defense of the region. During the revolt of 1810, Artigas joined the patriotic Junta which attempted to liberate Montevideo from Spanish dominion.<br><br>
A new epoch began in 1811 when Artigas inspired thousands to withdraw in a mass exodus from their homeland to the west bank of the Uruguay River. The exodus gave Artigas the stature of a leader and he guided the revolutionaries in a ten-year crusade to liberate the people from Imperial Spanish rule. The first major revolutionary victory took place on May 18, 1811 in the Battle of Las Piedras, and Artigas was subsequently named &#8220;Chief of the Orientales.&#8221; Influenced by the principles of American leaders George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Artigas established a provisional government in 1815 known as the Federal League. However, resurgent Portuguese forces brought about the demise of this democratic experiment. Artigas was forced to live in exile in Paraguay from 1820 until he died on September 23, 1850. The movement which Artigas inspired was eventually victorious; the First Republic of Uruguay was established on August 25, 1825.<br><br>
The larger-than-life statue of Artigas in Soho Square is a second cast of an original by José Luis Zorrilla de San Martín (1891-1975), which has stood in Montevideo, in front of the Uruguayan National Bank, since 1949. Zorrilla served as Director of the Uruguayan National Museum of Fine Arts, and was then considered his country’s outstanding sculptor. His father, Juan Zorrilla de San Martín, was both a poet and Uruguay’s Ambassador to Spain. This replica was fabricated by Vignali and Company, and placed on a Uruguayan granite base designed by architect Maria Cristina Caquías.<br><br>
Soho Square, in which the statue stands was one of several wedge-shaped public plazas created when Sixth Avenue was extended south of Carmine Street in the 1920s. The street was renamed Avenue of the Americas in 1945 at the suggestion of Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, to honor Pan-American ideals and principles. <br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Sixth Avenue, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This park commemorates four local heroes who perished in the face of fire, losing their lives that others might live. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Father Richard Fagan (1911-1938) moved with his family to Boston, Massachusetts as a child and later lived in Brooklyn, New York. He studied with the Marist Brothers in Poughkeepsie and entered the Preparatory Seminary at Catskill in 1926. Three years later, he graduated from St. Anthony’s Seraphic Seminary and entered the Novitiate in Pittsburgh. In 1932, he came to St. Francis Seraphic Seminary and was ordained a Franciscan priest in 1935. Father Fagan was called to duty at St. Anthony’s Church in 1936 and lived at the rectory at 151 Thompson Street.<br><br>
The rectory caught fire in the early morning of November 4, 1938. Father Fagan escaped and then twice reentered the burning building &#8211; first to rescue Father Louis Vitale, and again to save Father Bonaventure Pons. Trapped in the rectory and badly burned, Father Fagan leaped through a window to the roof of the Settlement House a floor below. He was found and brought to Columbus Hospital, where he died on November 9, 1938 at the age of twenty-seven. To describe Father Fagan’s heroic life and heroic death, members of his church quote the Book of John: "There is no greater love than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>
In 1994, another deadly fire stunned the neighborhood. On the night of March 28, Ladder Company 5 and Engine Company 24 of the Fire Department of New York responded to a blaze at 62 Watts Street. While operating on the second floor landing, Captain John J. Drennan (1945-1994) and firefighters James F. Young (1963-1994) and Christopher J. Siedenburg (1969-1994) were trapped in a sudden flashover from the burning apartment beneath them. Firefighter Young was killed almost instantly. Firefighter Siedenburg died the next day, and Captain Drennan died six weeks later.<br><br>
Located on Avenue of the Americas between Prince and Spring Streets, this sitting area was one of several wedge-shaped plazas developed when Sixth Avenue (the former official name of Avenue of the Americas) was extended south of Carmine Street in the mid-1920s. The park was named in memory of Father Fagan by local law in 1941 and was one of several properties along the avenue in the Greenwich Village area rehabilitated by NYC Parks in 1960.<br><br>
In 1994 three Callery Pear trees were planted, and three bronze plaques were installed next to trees on the northwest corner of the parcel, in memory of the three firefighters who sacrificed their lives in the Watts Street blaze. Neighborhood residents and members of the St. Anthony’s helping Hands group help to maintain and to beautify the park.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>From White Street to Central Park South, Sixth Avenue is known as Avenue of the Americas. It was named by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in 1945 to celebrate the unity of the Western Hemisphere. Because New York City played a critical role in fostering Pan-Americanism, lampposts along the avenue bear symbols of the different Western nations. At 59th Street, statues of Simon Bolivar, Jose de San Martin, and Jose Marti, donated by the governments of Venezuela, Argentina, and Cuba, stand at the entrance to Central Park. Each statue has its own plaza, designed by Gilmore D. Clarke. There is a statue of Brazil’s revolutionary, Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva, of the Avenues of the Americas near the entrance to Bryant Park, between 40th and 42nd Streets. The name was almost changed back to Sixth Avenue in 1984 to make it easier for tourists, but New Yorkers protested the change, and it officially remains Avenue of the Americas. <br><br>
Playground of the Americas is located on West Houston Street between MacDougal Street and Avenue of the Americas. Houston Street honors the American patriot William Houstoun (1755-1813). Houstoun was born in Savannah, Georgia, the son of Sir Patrick Houstoun, who was a Scottish member of Georgia’s royal colon8ial government. William Houston received a liberal education, which included legal training at London’s Inner Temple. When the Revolutionary War erupted in 1775, he returned from London to his predominantly royalist family in Georgia. Against his royalist father’s will, Houstoun supported the colonists’ grievances, and later championed armed resistance. Following the colonial victory in 1783, he served as a Georgia delegate to the Continental Congress from 1783 to 1786. In 1785, Houston settled Georgia’s border dispute with South Carolina. He also attended the Constitutional Convention for approximately two months during 1787. In 1788, he married Mary Bayard. Following his death, William Houstoun was interred at St. Paul’s Chapel churchyard in new York City.<br><br>
In the 1790s, Mary Bayard’s father, Nicholas Bayard III, constructed a street that ran east-west through a tract of land he owned, and named it after his son-in-law. In 1833, Houstoun Street was extended to North Street, which at the time was the city’s northernmost border on the East Side, and North Street was official named Houstoun Street. In 1858, Houstoun Street was connected to Hammersley Street to its west, and Hammersley Street, too, was subsequently renamed. The current spelling of the street, Houston, is a corruption; the last correct spelling of the street’s name was recorded in 1811. Because of this, the street name is often erroneously associated with Sam Houston (1793-1863), the commander of the Texan forces during the Texas War for Independence. In 1925, the City of New York acquired this property and transferred it to the Department of Transportation as part of a Sixth Avenue renovation. The Board of Estimate later placed the parcel under NYC Parks jurisdiction in May 1934. The playground remained unnamed until February 1998, when NYC Parks designated it Houston Plaza. In 2000, it was renamed Playground of the Americas.<br><br>
Mayor Giuliani sponsored a $93,000 renovation of the Playground of the Americas in 2000. The improvements included the repair of sidewalks and other paved areas. During the same year, the Mayor also sponsored a $35,000 renovation, which provided for the installation of modular play equipment and safety surfacing. The park features seal play sculptures, a water fountain, benches, and several London plane trees. A ground plaque dedicates the park as the &#8220;Playground of the Americas&#8221; in reference to Sixth Avenue’s full name.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On West Street, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This park was among the city’s first public spaces, officially recognized since 1686. At that time, it took its name from an actual canal that Canal Street later replaced. On October 12, 1920, the governors of New York and New Jersey met here to break ground for the Holland Tunnel. The 234-year-old park became a construction site and then a parking lot, until the local community’s dream to restore the historic park became a reality in 2005.<br><br>
From the time the first colonists arrived in New York in 1624 until the grid plan took effect in Manhattan in 1811, the city’s streets and squares evolved without a plan. People gathered to do business, talk and recreate wherever it suited them. On April 27, 1686, Thomas Dongan, the colony’s newly appointed governor, granted a new charter that gave control of vacant, unclaimed lands to the Common Council (an early predecessor of the City Council).<br><br>
Manhattan’s development did not reach here until the early 19th century, and by 1833 this triangle served as one of many public markets. Officially known as the Clinton Country Market from 1849 to 1860, it then stood on the north side of Canal Street until 1903. In 1871 the newly created Department of Public Parks took control of all pre-existing squares, and Canal Park received new sidewalks, a perimeter fence (relocated from City Hall Park), trees and shrubs. From that time until 1891, the pavement surrounding the park served as the city’s Flower Market.<br><br>
Landscape architects Calvert Vaux and Samuel Parsons, Jr. redesigned the park with a distinctively shaped path in 1888. The park maintained this layout until it housed pumps that provided pressurized air to workers in the tunnel’s construction caissons. After the Holland Tunnel opened, the park was not restored. In 1930 it was surrendered to the Manhattan Borough President’s office to aid in the construction of the elevated West Side Highway. For the remainder of the 20th century, the site served as a parking lot.<br><br>
A group of community activists called the Canal West Coalition discovered the site’s history and in 2000 won a case against the State Department of Transportation to make it a park once again. The park design replicates the pathway of 1888 and contains a decorative planter with engraved images of the original park. This park will be maintained partly through the private efforts of the Canal Park Conservancy.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Originally built in 1926-27 as the Beverly Hotel, this 25-story edifice is one of New York City’s premiere hotels constructed along the noted &#8220;Hotel Alley&#8221; stretch of Lexington Avenue. Its construction followed the opening of the famed Grand Central Terminal and the Lexington Avenue IRT subway line. Designed by Emery Roth as an apartment hotel, it featured many luxury amenities, including outdoor terraces and roof gardens. The facades are richly ornamented with stylized Romanesque motifs and incorporate whimsical details such as pelican and owl sculptures. In addition to warrior-head corbels, the hotel’s distinct profile made it a favorite subject for American artists of the 1920s, including Georgia O’Keefe, Alfred Stieglitz, and Charles Sheeler.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Originally built as a brownstone-faced townhouse in 1871, the Fisk-Harkness House was substantially altered in 1871 to the designs of architect Raleigh C. Gildersleeve. Best known for the Tudor-inspired buildings he designed for the campus of Princeton University, Gildersleeve transformed the row house into a grand Neo-Tudor Gothic-style townhouse. The asymmetrical limestone façade features an arched entry with a crocketed hood molding, late-Medieval-style leaded-glass windows, buttresses, and fanciful gargoyles. Harvey E. Fisk, the owner who commissioned the renovation, was a prominent investment banker. Later occupants of the Fisk-Harkness house included Standard Oil heir William L. Harkness, Symons Galleries, and Lim College. The Fisk-Harkness house is a rare survivor of the period when the area around Fifth Avenue in midtown was home to Manhattan’s wealthiest citizens, who built mansions or transformed existing row houses into their private residences.<br>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The first long mechanically ventilated underwater tunnel in the world designed for motor vehicle use<br><br>
The 29.5 ft. diameter 3,500 ft. long twin tubes of this tunnel were shield driven by the pneumatic method through extremely difficult river bottom conditions that were overcome by the ingenuity and determination of the engineers, Clifford M Holland, Milton H. Freeman and Ole Singstad. The tubes were the largest in the U.S. when built.<br><br>
The unprecedented length was a bold step forward in subsequent tunnel engineering.<br><br>
The principal feature of the cast iron-lined tunnel is the ventilating system. Its design was based on elaborate theories of physiological and mechanical tests conducted mainly by the U.S. Bureau of Mines.<br><br>
The resulting system - forcing fresh air in at roadway level and drawing off the exhaust-laden air at the ceiling over the entire tunnel length &#8211; had been the model for all succeeding vehicular tunnels. The air is moved by 42 blowing and 42 exhaust fans of 6000 total horsepower, arranged in 4 ventilation buildings.<br><br>
The tunnel is operated by The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey<br><br>

The site was created when this irregular section of Manhattan’s Hudson River shoreline was filled in by landfill in the first decades of the 19th Century. This modest building displays many distinctive Federal-style features, including Flemish Bond brickwork, brownstone window sills, cast-iron lintels, and a peaked roof. Built by merchant-tailor John G. Rohr, the building originally combined commercial space on the ground floor and residential space above. The current brick storefront dates from the 1940s.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near park path at St. Marks&#39;s Place, New York, (On the left when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This park honors Daniel D. Tompkins (1774&#8211;1825), who served as Governor of New York from 1807 to 1817 and as Vice President of the United States under James Monroe (1758-1831) from 1817 to 1825. Peter Stuyvesant (1610&#8211;1672), director general of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, owned this property during the 17th century. Tompkins later acquired it, and by the 19th century, it was marked for development as a public square.<br><br>
The Commissioners’ Plan of 1811 proposed a large market on this land stretching from First Avenue to the East River, but plans for the market never materialized. Bordered today by Avenues A and B, and 7th and 10th Streets, Tompkins Square Park was acquired by the City in 1834. Originally swampland, this site was graded and landscaped between 1835 and 1850. In 1866, the New York State Legislature ordered the City to remove a number of trees that had been planted at the time of the park’s creation to allow for an open parade ground for the Seventh Regiment of New York. A few Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) trees were spared, and of those, three survived to the present day. Believed to be the oldest trees in the park, two of the Sycamores can be found along 10th Street and the other is located on Avenue A at 9th Street.<br><br>
The New York State Legislature, bowing to pressure from city residents, redesignated the square as a public park in 1878, and it was redesigned the following year. Approximately 450 trees were planted and many of those remain in the park today. Species include Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), American elm (Ulmus Americana), and Oriental plane (Platanus orientalis).<br><br>
The park is home to several monuments, including the Temperance Memorial Fountain (1888), the Samuel S. Cox monument (1891), the Slocum Memorial Fountain (1906), several memorial plaques, and the Ukrainian-American Flagstaff (1942), which was donated by the Ukrainian Production Unit of the American Red Cross. A playground for girls was built in 1904, and in 1911, 10,000 people came here to witness the City’s first inter-park athletic championships. Parks Commissioner Robert Moses (1888&#8211;1981) expanded recreation opportunities in the park in the 1930s, adding handball courts and swing sets. A bandshell was completed in 1966 in time for frequent concerts and rallies, which characterized that period in history.
Since its beginnings in the 19th century, Tompkins Square Park has served as a place to voice dissent. Demonstrations in 1857 and 1875 about the lack of jobs and the poor economy gave way to local residents’ protests about gentrification in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1980s, police and East Village residents clashed after Parks began enforcing the park’s closing hours, in effect barring homeless from camping in the park. In 1991 the park was closed and dozens of homeless people who had been living in the park were relocated.<br><br>
The park was reconstructed and reopened in the summer of 1992. During this renovation, the bandshell was removed, a state-of-the-art dog run and new playgrounds were built, several monuments conserved, and the turf and sidewalks replaced. Today Tompkins Square Park continues to serve a diverse community, providing a peaceful, meditative environment within the bustle of city life.<br><br>

    <name><![CDATA[Temperance Fountain]]></name>
    <cmt><![CDATA[Near Avenue A, New York, (On the right when traveling north)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[Dating to 1888, this neo-classical fountain was the gift of the wealthy San Francisco dentist, businessman, and temperance crusader Henry D. Cogswell (1820&#8211;1900). <br><br>
Cogswell was born in Tolland, Connecticut in 1820, the son of an architect and builder. His mother died when he was young, and the family relocated to Orwell, New York. At age nine Cogswell returned alone to Connecticut, and endured &#8220;eight years of labor in southern Connecticut and Rhode Island cotton mills, itinerant wanderings, and incarceration in a poorhouse." Managing to transcend these ordeals, and largely self-taught, Cogswell served as principal of Orwell High School, studied medicine, and became a dentist.<br><br>
News of the California Gold Rush of 1849 lured Cogswell to San Francisco. There his prosperous dental practice and real estate investments permitted him to retire in 1856 with a fortune estimated at $2,000,000. He engaged himself in public philanthropy, founding the Cogswell Polytechnic Institute, and helping to advance the anti-alcohol or &#8220;temperance&#8221; movement. Often, his charitable acts were tinged with self-promotion, and in an effort to embellish his humble origins, he adopted the coat of arms of Humphrey Cogswell, a 15th-century English lord, from whom Henry falsely claimed his lineage. <br><br>
Cogswell’s most lasting legacy was the 50 monuments he sponsored nationwide between 1878 and the 1890s. Most were versions of the temperance fountain. Several of the fountains, such as those in Washington, D. C., Boston Common, and in Tompkins Square Park, were covered by a stone canopy or baldachin supported by four Doric columns. As can be seen here, the four stone entablatures were emblazoned with the words Faith, Hope, Charity, and Temperance.<br><br>
The erection of the <i>Temperance Fountain</i> in Tompkins Square Park resulted from Cogswell’s affiliation with the Moderation Society, which was formed in 1877 to address health conditions on the Lower East Side, and to distribute free ice-water fountains to encourage citizens to drink water instead of alcoholic beverages. Cogswell served as the group’s honorary president in 1890, and the collaboration produced another temperance fountain at the New York City main post office at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue.<br><br>
The figure of Hebe, the mythical water carrier, atop the pyramidal stone pediment was originally fabricated in zinc by the J. L. Mott Iron Works in Mott Haven in the Bronx. The classically-styled figure is based on a marble statue made circa 1816 by the renowned Danish sculptor Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen (c.1770&#8211;1844). Thorvaldsen’s 1839 marble self-portrait stands in Central Park at East 97th Street.<br><br>
Though the four ornamental luminaires with red, white and blue tinted glass, which once flanked the fountain, long ago vanished, this monument has withstood the vagaries of time better than most. In 1992, the fountain underwent extensive restoration, and the Hebe statue was replaced with a more durable bronze replica.<br><br>

(1867-1815)<br>
and<br>
Giuseppe Moretti<br>
(1857-1935)</center>
<br>
In 1891 Karl Bitter won the competition for the design of the Tympanum and Doors of Trinity Church on Broadway and Wall Street. The earnings from this, his first major commission, enabled him, with Giuseppe Moretti, to finance the construction of this studio. Bitter is probably best known to New Yorkers for his statue of <i>Pomona or Abundance</i>, which stands in the Pulitzer Fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel. This was his last work, the clay model completed shortly before his death and later cast by his assistants. Other works in Manhattan include sculptural elements on the facades of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Appellate Court Building on Madison Square, and the U.S. Customs House next to Battery Park.<br><br>
Giuseppe Moretti created the largest cast iron statue in the world, the fifty-six foot <i>Vulcan</i>, which overlooks the city of Birmingham, Alabama. His first major commission in the United States was for marble friezes and statuary in the <i>Marble House</i> of William Kissam Vanderbilt in Newport, Rhode Island. For most of his career he lived in Pittsburgh, where many notable works can be found. Among them are the Steven Collins Foster Memorial and two entrances to Highland Park. A gifted singer, his tenor voice was frequently praised by his friend Enrico Caruso.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>Samuel Sullivan &#8220;Sunset&#8221; Cox (1824&#8211;1889) was born in Zanesville, Ohio, and served his home state as a Democratic Congressional representative from 1857 to 1865 before being unseated. After moving to New York in 1866, Cox served again in Congress for several terms from 1869 until 1889.<br><br>
Although Cox once publicly declared that his most satisfying contribution to public service was championing the Life Saving Service&#8212;founded in the 1840s to patrol the coasts and save imperiled boaters during bad weather, the group was absorbed into the Coast Guard in 1915&#8212;this statue is sponsored by U.S. Postal Service workers because of Cox’s support for their quality-of-life issues. Known as the &#8220;letter-carriers’ friend,&#8221; Cox spearheaded legislation that led to paid benefits and a 40-hour workweek for postal employees. Mail carriers from the 188 cities named on the monument contributed $10,000 for the statue in a campaign that began soon after Cox’s death.<br><br>
Sculptor Louise Lawson’s statue of Cox, unveiled in 1891, depicts him orating before Congress. Lawson (186?&#8211;1899) came from a prominent Ohio family. She and her brother, U.S. Representative W. D. Lawson, both attended Cox’s 1889 funeral at which President Grover Cleveland and General William Sherman served as honorary pallbearers. One might interpret the statue’s somewhat stiff quality as representative of Cox’s steadfast stance on issues for which he advocated.<br><br>
After the statue’s unveiling on Independence Day 1891, the New York Tribune noted, somewhat less charitably, that Cox’s &#8220;usually genial countenance is strained&#8221; and &#8220;out of harmony&#8221; with the Congressman’s natural demeanor. &#8220;The likeness is not a good one, and the facial resemblance is hardly suggestive,&#8221; the article added. A New York Times account of the ceremony questioned whether the statue &#8220;will ever be greatly admired as a work of art.&#8221; Nevertheless, a reported 2,500 letter carriers came from as far away as New Orleans and Memphis to participate in the moving ceremony to honor Cox at the statue’s unveiling.<br><br>
The statue originally stood near Cox’s home on East 12th Street at the intersection of Lafayette Street, Fourth Avenue, and Astor Place. In November 1924, due to a street-widening project in the vicinity of Astor Place, it was moved to its current location at the southwest corner of Tompkins Square Park.<br><br>
In 1998, the monument was conserved by the Citywide Monuments Conservation Program. The treatment included cleaning, repatination, and application of a protective coating to the bronze sculpture and plaques. The pedestal was also cleaned and the lettering was remolded on the front side of the base.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On East 8th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>The Firemen’s Garden on East Eighth Street between Avenues C and D honors the memory of all New York City firefighters who were killed in the line of duty. The site pays homage in particular to the memory of Martin R. Celic (1952-1977), a young member of Ladder Company 18 who lost his life fighting a fire in the tenement that once stood here. <br><br>
Marty Celic was born April 10, 1952, on Staten Island, the son of Inez and Mathias Celic. He attended Monsignor Farrell High School, where he ran track and broke the school record in the intermediate hurdles. In and out of school, he was known for his exuberance and drive, his love of practical jokes, his joyous irreverence, and his friendliness. He attended John Jay College, and joined the Fire Department a few years later. <br><br>
In mid-1975, New York City faced a budget crisis, and many recent hires, including Celic, were laid off. Over the next year, Celic worked at a variety of jobs and returned to his alma mater as an assistant track coach. He loved fighting fires, however, and was happy when he was rehired on Christmas Day, 1976. <br><br>
On July 2, 1977, at 3:10 P.M., a fire broke out on the fifth floor of an abandoned building on this site. Ladder Company 15, including Celic, who was working overtime, spotted the smoke on the way back to the station after a false alarm. When the firefighters arrived, the blaze was spreading up the building. After the men entered the building, the teenager who had started the fire went back in and set another fire, on the second floor, trapping the firemen in the blazing structure. <br><br>
Ladder Company 11 raised its rescue platform to the fifth-floor window, and the firemen had to crawl onto the fire escape and jump to the &#8220;cherry picker.&#8221; Struggling through smoke and with heavy equipment on his back, Marty Celic missed the cherry picker and fell 70 feet to the ground. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he died eight days later, on July 10, 1977. He was twenty-five years old and had been planning to be married that October. <br><br>
Marty Celic received the Fire Department Medal of Valor posthumously, as well as the Medal of Supreme Sacrifice from the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the United Firefighters Officers Association. He was honored as Fireman of the Year by the Crime Victims’ Rights Organization. His former company, Ladder 18, established the Martin Celic Scholarship Fund, which awards a yearly scholarship to a junior at Monsignor Farrell High School who combines academic achievement with excellence in track. The Marty Celic Four-Mile Run is held annually in Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island to raise money for the fund. <br><br>
Longtime neighborhood residents Ansley and Kelly Carnahan had begun gardening in the lot adjacent to the abandoned building in 1975. After the burnt-out building was condemned and torn down, the Carnahans and other local residents expanded their garden to the new lot. Beginning with planting beds across the front, the garden grew slowly to its present size, with a grassy plot in the center and woodsy pathways at the back. The gardeners received help from the Green Guerrillas, GreenThumb, and other organizations and individuals. They named the garden in honor of those who risk their lives daily in every borough and district. Marty Celic’s family donated benches made of cedar and wrought iron.<br><br> 
The garden was leased through GreenThumb in 1980, and incorporated as a non-profit in 1989. The Fire Department held a dedication ceremony in the garden in December of 1988, and a plaque commemorating Marty Celic was installed. The Firemen’s Garden was transferred to Parks in 1999. The transfer grants the garden the security of Parklands status while leaving the administration and maintenance to the local residents. Birthday parties are celebrated here, as well as Independence Day, Memorial Day, and Labor Day. A special ceremony is held in mid-July in remembrance of the sacrifices of all New York City firemen.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On First Avenue, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
A sliver of Manhattan bounded by Houston Street, First Avenue, and Avenue A, Peretz Square marks the spot where the tangled jumble of lower Manhattan meets the regularity of the Commissioners’ Plan street grid.<br><br>
With the implementation of the Manhattan grid plan proposed in 1811, a new order of north-south avenues and east-west streets was imposed upon New York City. First Avenue opened to traffic in 1813, and by the end of the year, stretched from North Street to 25th Street. (North Street, then the northern boundary of settled Manhattan, was later renamed for William Houstoun, a Georgia delegate to the Continental Congress). The new grid system did not align exactly with North Street, and with the opening of First Street from North Street to First Avenue in 1824, this small triangle was formed. This area, which had been the uppermost settled area of Manhattan, became known as the Lower East Side, as the burgeoning city expanded northward.<br><br>
Many of the Eastern European Jews who immigrated to the United States between 1880 and 1920 settled in the Lower East Side. By 1920 an estimated 400,000 Jews lived in this area. Most were native speakers of Yiddish, and many were devoted readers of the works of I.L. Peretz, the Polish playwright and poet. Peretz played a major role in the early development of both Yiddish and Hebrew literature, and was particularly beloved for his simultaneous appreciation of both traditional Judaism and socialist doctrine.<br><br>
Isaac Loeb Peretz (1852-1915) was born in Zamosc, Poland to a religious family. As a young lawyer, he wrote primarily in Polish, and belonged to the Haskalah, or &#8220;enlightenment&#8221; movement, which called for a greater assimilation of Jews into the larger community. He published a number of works in Hebrew, including his first major poem, Li Omerim (‘They Tell Me’), but little in Yiddish, the vernacular language of Russian and Eastern European Jews. After a series of vicious pogroms in 1881, however, Peretz developed strong nationalistic leanings and an appreciation of the role that Yiddish could play in awakening a Jewish national identity. Accusations of radicalism in the late 1880s cost him his legal license, and from then on he made his primary livelihood through his writing.<br><br>
Peretz’s first major work in Yiddish was his ironic poem Monish in 1888, published in Shalom Aleichem’s <i>Di Yidishe Folksbibliotek.</i> Moving to Warsaw in 1890, he became increasingly involved in the socialist movement, and was imprisoned for several months in 1899. During this period, Peretz edited several Yiddish journals, and also published a number of volumes in Hebrew, including a collection of love poems titled <i>Ha-Ugav</i> (‘The Harp’). He continued his socialist activity but, despite his hopes for a Jewish national awakening, did not join the Zionist movement (which was formally established in the late 19th century), believing that the future of the Jewish people lay rather in an enlightened Diaspora.<br><br>
Later in his career, he grew cautious about the future of socialism, addressing a socialist meeting with the prescient remark &#8220;I hope for your victory, but I fear and dread it.&#8221; Together with Shalom Aleichem and Mendele Mocher Seforim, Peretz pioneered a number of literary genres in Yiddish, including the short story and the symbolic drama. Upon his death in 1915, over 100,000 Polish Jews attended his funeral in Warsaw.<br><br>
This site was acquired by NYC Parks on May 9, 1934, when the Board of Transportation issued a permit to Parks for temporary use and occupation. On November 23, 1952, Manhattan Borough President (later Mayor) Robert F. Wagner, Jr. dedicated Peretz Square, saying &#8220;[Peretz’s] writings gave hope and purpose to his people.&#8221;<br><br>
Peretz Square is part of the Greenstreets program, a joint project of NYC Parks and the NYC Department of Transportation that began in 1986 and was revived in 1994 with the goal to convert paved street properties, such as triangles and malls, into green spaces. This park has been cared for since September 11, 2001 by the Friends of Peretz Square.]]></desc>

There was an actual deed for the sale of Manhattan but it vanished long ago. Fortunately, a Dutch official was on the dock in Amsterdam in 1626 when a ship from Manhattan arrived. The letter he wrote to his superior is, in effect, New York City’s birth certificate:<br><br>
High and Mighty Lords,<br>
Yesterday the ship the Arms of Amsterdam arrived here. It sailed from New Netherland out of the river Mauritius on the 23rd of September. They report that our people are in good spirit and live in peace. The women have borne some children there. They have purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indians for the value of 60 guilders. It is 13,000 morgens in size. They had all their grain sowed by the middle of May, and reaped by the middle of August. They sent samples of these summer grains: wheat, rye, barley, oats, Buckwheat, canary seed, beans and flax.<br>
The cargo of the aforesaid ship is:
1246 Beaver skins<br>
178&#189; Otter skins<br>
675 Otter skins<br>
48 Mink skins<br>
36 Lynx skins<br>
33 Minks<br>
34 Muskrat skins<br>
Many oak timbers and nut wood<br>
Herewith, High and Mighty Lords, he commended to the mercy of the Almighty<br>
In Amsterdam, the 5th of November Anno 1636<br>
Your High and Mightiness. obedient<br>

Peter Minuit arrived at a colony in turmoil. Some 150 miles upriver from the harbor, several Dutch soldiers were killed by Mohawk Indians. The settlers panicked. In 1626, they found their leader, Verhulst, guilty of mismanagement, removed him from power, and voted Minuet their new commander.<br><br>
Minuit’s first decision would change history. He saw that the settlers were spread out across 100 miles of wilderness. The original idea had been to use Noten Island (later Governor’s Island) as a capital, but it was too small. Manhattan &#8211; after the Indian word for &#8220;The Island&#8221; - was large enough to support a population. It sat in a world-class harbor, at the mouth of a great river that gave access to the interior.<br><br>
Manhattan was, in short, a fulcrum between the development of Europe and the raw landscape of North America &#8211; the perfect island.]]></desc>

By tens and twenties the settlers came in 1624 and 1625, pitching on the inhuman waves in frightfully vulnerable wooden ships. Two months it took to follow in the wake of the English explorer Henry Hudson, three if the winds failed. Hudson has sailed in 1609 on behalf of the Dutch East India Company, so the Dutch claimed the territory and named their colony New Netherland. The Dutch provinces were the melting pot of Europe and the settlers themselves were a mix of peoples. Their colony stretched across a huge swath of North America, covering all or part of five future states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The ships arrived at what would be New York harbor.<br><br>
&#8220;We were much gratified at arriving in this country,&#8221; one settler wrote home. &#8220;Here we found a beautiful river, bubbling fountains flowing down into the valleys…&#8221;]]></desc>

Every reader of history knows the story: Peter Minuit bought Manhattan Island in 1626 from a group of Indians for 60 guilders worth of goods, or as a 19th century historian calculated it, 24 dollars. Of the thousands of transactions in which native Americans sold parcels to Europeans, only one is legend. It’s clear why this sale lodged in the cultural memory: the absurd price. It is the most dramatic illustration of the long process of stripping the natives of their land.<br><br>
In fact, the Manhattan Indians had no concept of permanent property transfer but saw the agreement more as a treaty of cooperation. The Dutch would be allowed to use the land, but the Indians would remain as well and indeed they did throughout the life of the colony. The so-called purchase price for them was a token of alliance, which Minuet would have understood.]]></desc>

Under Peter Minuit, the settlers of the little city of New Amsterdam worked quickly. By about 1627 they had 30 wooden houses constructed along &#8220;The Strand&#8221;, facing the bluffed shore 500 yards across the water of what would soon be named &#8220;Breuckelen.&#8221; The one stone building was a West India Company headquarters, where pelts were stored. There were two windmills: one for grinding grain, the other for sawing lumber.<br><br>
Minuit also oversaw the construction of a fort. It was built mostly of heaped earth; it began to crumble even before it was finished. Indeed, the ramshackle state of Fort Amsterdam would be an issue right up until the moment in 1664, when Peter Stuyvesant, standing on its unsteady ramparts, surrendered it to the English. The fort’s outlines are apparent in the &#8220;footprint&#8221; of the old customs House just opposite Battery Park.<br>]]></desc>

As the settlers explored their island, they found it was wondrously varied: high hills, charging streams, ponds, stands of chestnut, poplar and pine. A brook flowed from the highlands in the area of 59th street and Fifth Avenue, about where the Plaza Hotel stands, to empty into a small bay on the East River. &#8220;The ground in the flat land near the river is covered in strawberries, one settler noted, &#8220;which grew so plentifully in the fields, that one can lie down and eat them.&#8221;<br><br>
The Manhattan Indians called the path that ran the island’s length the Wickquasgeck trail. The Europeans could follow it northward to hunt in the forest at the island’s center. As it was the most prominent road on the island, when the Dutch widened the path they referred to it as the Gentlemen’s Street or High Street. The English, of course, called it Broadway.<br>]]></desc>

Something was happening that was quite unlike the development of the English colonies of Virginia and New England. Their island was a node on the Atlantic shipping circuit, held together by Dutch notions of free trade and tolerance, and it flourished. Products flowed in, bound for Europe. Slavery increased so that in 1664 there were about 300 slaves in the colony. In 1653, New Amsterdam became an official Dutch city. The tavern was christened as City Hall. Roads were paved with cobbles; brick houses replaced wooden ones. people of different backgrounds &#8211; Swedish, English, French, Dutch, German-Danish &#8211; intermarried to an extent unbelievable of elsewhere.<br>
A new kind of society was forming.]]></desc>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On State Street, New York, (On the right when traveling south)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[This monument honors engineer John Wolfe Ambrose (1838-1899), whose vision and persistence resulted in the deep sea channel to New York Harbor, which improved the visibility of the Port of New York, making New York City the heart of commerce in the United States. This channel is named in his honor.<br><br>
Ambrose was born on January 10, 1838 in New Castle, Ireland, and as a child immigrated with his family to the United States. Though forced to work at an early age, he prepared for college, and later attended New York and Princeton universities. While he intended to join the ministry, in 1860 he joined the staff of the Citizens’ Association, one of the City’s earlier reform movements.<br><br>
Later in his career, Ambrose was involved in several significant construction projects, including the building of the Second Avenue and Sixth Avenue elevated rails, the pneumatic tubes for the Western Union Telegraph Company, and the development of many northern Manhattan streets, particularly in Harlem.<br><br>
In the 1880s, Ambrose organized and was president of the Brooklyn Wharf and Dry Dock Company, and the founder of the 39th Street South Brooklyn Ferry. Long interested in the development of the Brooklyn waterfront industry, Ambrose recognized the inadequacy of the swampy and shallow shoreline, lobbying congressional river and harbor committees to appropriate the necessary funds to create a channel which could accommodate large enough ships to sustain New York’s maritime economy. In the late 1890s, his appearance before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce helped secure funds to construct a suitably deep and wide harbor channel, and for his efforts the 1901-02 Congress named that channel for Ambrose.<br><br>
Soon after his death, friends of Ambrose gave his children a sculptural portrait bust by Andrew O’Connor Jr. (1874-1941), a well-respected sculptor of his day who received many private and public commissions. In the 1930s, Ambrose’s family in turn gave the sculpture to the city. NYC Parks’ chief consultant architect Aymer Embury II (1880-1966) designed an architectural setting and wall niche for the sculpture which was inserted into the New York Aquarium at Castle Garden, and decorated with a relief map of the harbor by Frederick G.R. Roth (1872-1944). The monument was dedicated by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (1882-1947) on June 3, 1936.<br><br>
In the 1950s, the monument was relocated to the south wall of the concession building in lower Battery Park, but in November 1990 the bronze bust was stolen from its niche. The monument was fully restored and relocated in 2017 to a more visible, newly landscaped park perimeter location at State and Pearl Streets, and its long-missing bust recreated by referencing historical photographs. On May, 2018 the monument was re-dedicated in a ceremony attended by numerous descendants of Ambrose.<br><br>

Harry Hopkins, one of the most influential non-elected officials in American history, became a Settlement House worker in 1912 at Christodora, where his exposure to the struggles of new immigrants helped shape his thinking about social reform. Christodora, launched in 1897, was then housed in 143/145/147 Avenue B, and to this day continues its mission to help alleviate inequities among the underserved, In 1933, President Roosevelt asked Hopkins to implement the Social Security Act of 1935, and to direct the Works progress Administration, which hired more than 3 million unemployed to rebuild highways, bridges, public buildings, and parks. During WWII, he was Secretary of Commerce and FDR’s personal representative to London and Moscow. In 1945, Hopkins helped arrange the Potsdam Conference for President Truman, who honored him with the Distinguished Service Medal.<br>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><i>Let us brace our hearts to fresh endurance,<br>
Let us adjust our minds to action, energetic, righteous;<br>
Let us uplift our consciousness by faith invisible<br>
for the nation cannot perish that had a soul so great, so immortal!<br>
-Ignacy Jan Paderewski, 1910</i><br><br>
This Red oak tree (Quercus ruba), dedicated in 1941, honors Ignacy Jam Paderewski (1860-1941), Polish piano virtuoso, composer, and statesman. Placing his music aside during World War I (1914-1918), he devoted himself to the cause of Polish freedom. At the close of the war, Poland became independent again for the first time since the 18th century, due largely to his efforts.<br><br>
Paderewski enjoyed a brilliant worldwide concert career, and marked his new York debut at Carnegie Hall on November 17, 1891. His performance there during the hall’s inaugural season, established a precedent, and nearly all major classical musicians since have made debuts at Carnegie Hall. Proceeds from many of his concerts went to charities, including the Polish war relief.<br><br>
His devotion to Poland was lifelong. Paderewski represented his country at the Versailles Peace Conference and the League of Nations; he later served as Poland’s premier and foreign minister. He resumed (his concert) career in 1922, making his final American tour in 1939. A few months later Germany (invaded Poland?) and Paderewski was named president of the new Polish parliament-in-exile. On a fund-raising (mission?) he came to the United States, &#8220;the country of his heart,&#8221; and died in New York City on June (29, 1941.)<br><br>
When word of Paderewski’s death reached President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945), he had the State Department inform official of the Polish Government-in-exile that Paderewski’s body could temporarily be interred in (the) vault below the mast of the USS Maine monument in Arlington National cemetery. Roosevelt remarked, &#8220;He may lie there until Poland is free.&#8221; His body lay in state at the Polish embassy in Washington D.C., and was soon entombed at the monument.<br><br>
With the collapse of the communist government in Poland in the early 1990s, Paderewski’s body was finally returned to his native land. On July 5, 1992, after two days of ceremony, Ignacy Jan Paderewski was laid to rest in the crypt of the Cathedral of St. John in Warsaw. His heart remains in the United States, following his wishes, and is encased in a bronze sculpture at the Shrine of the Czestochowa in the predominantly Polish-American community of Doylestown, Pennsylvania.<br><br>

    <desc><![CDATA[This is the site of the former St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church (1857 to 1940) a mostly German immigrant parish. On Wednesday, June 15, 1904, the church chartered the excursion steamer, <b>General Slocum,</b> to take the members on the 17th annual Sunday school picnic. The steamer sailed up the East River, with some 1400 passengers aboard, when it entered the infamous Hell Gate passage, caught fire and was beached and sank on North Brother Island. It is estimated 1200 people lost their lives, mostly women and children, dying within yards of the Bronx shores.<br>
The <b>General Slocum</b> had been certified by the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service to safely carry 2500 passengers five weeks before the disaster. An investigation after the fire and sinking found the lifeboats were wired and glued with paint to the deck, life jackets fell apart with age, fire hose (sic) burst under water pressure, and the crew never has a fire drill.<br>
Until the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the Slocum disaster had been the largest fire fatality in New York City’s history.<br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near East 9th Street, New York, ]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
Dedicated in 1906, this fountain serves as a reminder of those who died aboard the excursion steamer General Slocum on June 15, 1904. Prior to September 11, 2001, the burning of the General Slocum had the highest death toll of any disaster in New York City history. The incident claimed an irreplaceable part of the Lower East Side community once known as Little Germany and remains the worst inland-waters, peacetime tragedy in the nation’s history. <br>
The Slocum was a triple-decker wooden ship built in 1891, named after General Henry Warner Slocum (1827-1894) who commanded the extreme right line of the Union Army at Gettysburg and represented the City of Brooklyn in Congress for three terms. It was one of nearly a dozen excursion steamers that traveled around New York waterways, enabling working class people to escape the city even if just for a few hours. On its final voyage, the Slocum was to vary its normal two trips to the Rockaways in order to bring a large party to Locust Grove on Long Island. <br>
The approximately 1,300 passengers and 35 member crew included the congregation of St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, located on 6th Street near 2nd Avenue, who were en route to their seventeenth annual picnic. As it was a weekday, the majority of the German immigrants and people of German descent who comprised the group were women and children. This was also true for the other passengers who hailed from all over the New York area. <br>
Twenty minutes after the ship departed the Third Street pier on the East River, it entered the ever treacherous junction of the East River, New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. There it was overtaken not by the current but by flames and Captain William Van Schaik docked, shortly after 10AM, at North Brother Island, near Riker’s Island. Of the more than 1,000 people who died, many were buried in the Lutheran cemetery in Middle Village, Queens, where a monument was erected in 1905 to honor the unidentified dead. The disaster was the fatal end of a ship with a history of accidents and was attributed to inadequate safety precautions and the negligence of the Captain. <br>
The Slocum Memorial Fountain by sculptor Bruno Louis Zimm was donated by the Sympathy Society of German Ladies and installed in Tompkins Square Park, a central feature of the neighborhood. The nine foot upright stele is made of pink Tennessee marble with a low relief of two children looking seaward as well as a lionhead spout. Zimm, who was a member of the Woodstock Artists Colony, also designed a similar fountain, the Women’s Health Protective Monument, located at 116th Street and Riverside Drive, and the frieze on the pediment of the Fine Arts building in San Francisco. <br>
The monument was restored in 1991 under a Parks capital project. In 1990 a Slocum Memorial Fountain Fund in excess of $6000 was raised by popular subscription by the Slocum Memorial Committee which as been succeeded by the Maritime Industry Museum at Fort Schuyler, site of the SUNY maritime College, in The Bronx. The funds are held by the Municipal Art Society as part of New York City’s Adopt-A-Monument program.<br>]]></desc>

The Lamartine Place Historic District is comprised of 12 remaining houses from a block-long row of Greek Revival style brick homes developed in the mid-19th century by Cyrus Mason and William Torrey. Noted Quaker abolitionists Abby Hopper Gibbons and James Sloane Gibbons lived at 18 and later 19 Lamartine Place (now 337 and 339 West 29th Street). Their home was a documented stop on the Underground Railroad, which helped freedom-seeking slaves on their journey to Canada, and served as a meeting place for abolitionists before the Civil War. The house was vandalized after Lincoln’s Emancipation proclamation on January 1, 1863, and was ransacked and torched when the Draft Riots of July 1863 set off four days of looting, arson and lynching in New York City. The Gibbons’ daughters escaped the mob by fleeing over the rooftops of adjoining houses to a carriage waiting below. The district has survived as a rare extant physical reminder of this violent chapter in the city’s and nation’s history.]]></desc>

Left: A Floating Metropolis<br>
A plan to create a new residential and commercial neighborhood on the site of the decaying Hudson River piers was first proposed in the early 1960s. Battery Park City is a remarkable technological achievement. To build it, 92 acres of Hudson River waterfront were filled with sand dredged from the bottom of Long Island Sound and dirt and rock excavated during construction of the World Trade Center. Apartment towers and office buildings, parks and playgrounds are all built on landfill, and the Esplanade stands on as enormous &#8220;sandwich,&#8221; supported by pilings driven into the Hudson River bottom. The top of the &#8220;sandwich,&#8221; either planting beds or pavement, is separated from the structural concrete platform below by three feet of soil and three feet of sand.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[On Gansevoort Street, New York, (On the left when traveling west)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>At the request of Community Board 2, and by decision of the City Planning Commission, Parks, and Borough President Hulan E. Jack, this open space was carved out of Manhattan's crowded West Village. During the early 1950s, Anthony Dapolito, lifetime park advocate and then chairman of Community Board 2, had successfully worked for the creation of Thompson Playground in SoHo. Residents of the West Village were inspired to approach Community Board 2 and Parks Commissioner Robert Moses for a playground in their neighborhood. <br><br>
On April 9, 1958, the City Planning Commission held a site selection hearing. One of the proposed sites would have required the displacement and relocation of ninety-five tenants, as well as a fire station. The location chosen, however, on Hudson Street, between Horatio and Gansevoort, would displace only twelve families. Aside from three residential brownstones, the project required the demolition of a Department of Sanitation garage, and express depot, a waste paper loft building, a furniture warehouse, and a parking lot. Only the nine-story office building facing West 4th Street would be spared.<br><br>
Opponents of the playground denounced the design as a "white elephant," and claimed local civic groups and boards had not been adequately consulted. Its advocates, however, were confident that the residential Village would expand towards the west, and that the open space would be needed. On November 17, 1959, the Board of Estimate authorized the acquisition by condemnation of "all the structures, together with the appurtenances thereto, on property acquired for a park."<br><br>
The new playground featured full and half-size basketball courts, a baseball diamond, and a children's play area with a sand box, swings, baby swings, a slide, and four see-saws. As the hands and feet of small Villagers first made their marks in the sand, members of the 60's generation were sent to tread unknown ground in the Vietnam War. Corporal John A. Seravalli, "a youth of the neighborhood," fell on February 28, 1967, in South Vietnam. His father, a member of the American Legion, asked that the City Council rename the playground in memory of the corporal. While Community Board 2 wanted to rename the playground in a way which would recognize all fallen soldiers from the Village, perhaps "Memorial Playground," the City Council approved the family's petition. On May 8, 1968, a small bronze plaque was affixed to the brick comfort station, telling of the corporal's death at age 21, and remembering his service in the war. <br><br>
In 1986 the fence surrounding the playground was elevated, to prevent stray baseballs from damaging pedestrians or windows. The playground was renovated in 1992. Two handball courts replaced the see-saws, the children's area was re-centered around climbing apparatus, and picnic tables were installed under the cover of trees. Several generations of children have now enjoyed the playground, which accommodates an ever-increasing residential community.<br><br>

Samuel Fraunces, a West Indian innkeeper, was the proprietor; he later became Washington’s chief steward. Fraunces, also an American patriot, was host to secret meetings of the Sons of Liberty and gave aid to American prisoners of war.

    <desc><![CDATA[Samuel Fraunces in 1762 named his Queen’s Head tavern after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. His politics, however, were strictly patriotic, and his tavern hosted meetings of the radical Sons of Liberty and, later, the New York Provincial Congress. Washington’s farewell to his officers at the end of the Revolutionary War, on December 4, 1783 in the Long Room of the renamed Fraunces Tavern, made this building one of New York’s great patriotic shrines.<br><br>Famous for his cooking, especially desserts, Fraunces advertised &#8220;Cakes, Tarts, Jellies, Whip Syllabubs, Blaumage Sweet-Meats, &c. in any quantity; cold Meat in small Quantities, Beef Stakes, &c at any Hour; Pickled Oysters for the West Indies or elsewhere.&#8221; After the war, which ruined him financially, Fraunces entered Washington’s service as steward and chef, and Congress rented his tavern to house the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Treasury and War.<br><br>Threatened with replacement by a skyscraper in 1902, the much altered Tavern was rescued by the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, under the direction of architect William Mersereau. Today’s Long Room, remodeled in the 1960s after period prints and paintings, recreates a typical 18th century tavern room of the kind in which Washington made his famous farewell.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Vietnam Veterans Plaza<br><br>
The triangular area now known as Vietnam Veterans Plaza was built in 1971. The site, formerly named Jeanette Park, was named in honor of <i>The Jeanette,</i> the flagship of an ill-fated Arctic expedition (1879-1881). In 1982, the site was chosen as the home for the Vietnam Veterans memorial, and named by the City Council in honor of the memorial, which was dedicated in 1985. The Plaza and Memorial now stand as New York City’s testimonial to the brave young men and women who served our country during the Vietnam War.<br><br>
In an effort to transform the Vietnam Veterans Plaza into an attractive and dignified setting for this important memorial, a public/private coalition was formed to lead its redesign and reconstruction with support from the Vietnam Veterans community, the Alliance for Downtown New York, City of New York Parks & Recreation and the City Parks Foundation. Major funding for the project was provided by the Retirement Systems of Alabama, owners of 55 Water Street, a variety of private donors with allocations from the Mayor through the Department of Parks & Recreation, and from the City Council, and the Manhattan Borough President.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[100 Old Slip was designed by the notable architectural firm of Hunt & Hunt in the New-Italian Renaissance style. Its visual power is created by a rhythmic series of tall arches, heavy rusticated walls and restrained ornamentation. The building's distinctive profile with its dominating cornice is reminiscent of the Plazzo Riccardi in Florence. Built in 1909-11, this impressive public building served until 1973 as the home of the First Precinct Police Station, replacing an 1884 police station house. The 1884 station house was constructed after the Great Fire of 1835 on the site of the former Franklin Market. From 1993-2001, the former First Precinct Police Station served as the office of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. In December 2001, the building was re-purposed and dedicated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as the home of the New York City Police Museum.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><i>Peking</i> was launched in 1911 at Hamburg, Germany by the Blohm & Voss shipyard. She was owned by the F. Laeisz Company of that port, who used here to carry fuel and manufactured goods to the West Coast of South America, around Cape Horn, and return to European ports with nitrate mined in northern Chile. The nitrate was used to fertilize the worn-out fields of Europe and to manufacture chemicals for various applications, including munitions. <br><br>
With her four-masted bark rig, steel hull and masts, and midship bridge deck, <i>Peking</i> represents the final generation of sailing ships built for world trade. Thought a product of the 20th century, she still sailed in the traditional way, with few labor-saving devices or safety features. Her crew followed the standard sailing vessel routine of four hours on duty and four hours off duty, alternating around the clock, seven days a week. <br><br>
The number of sails set depended on the strength of the wind. When it increased , the sails had to be taken in quickly, no matter what the weather conditions. A ton or more of heavy canvas had to be gathered up by hauling on lines from the deck. For the final furling, the men had to climb &#8220;ratlines&#8221; almost as high as a seventeen-story building, go out on swaying footropes rigged from the yards, and bundle up the sail with their bare hands. <br><br>
<i>Peking</i> was retired in 1933, when steamers using the Panama Canal took over what was left of the nitrate trade. She served as a nautical school for boys, moored in a British river, until she was acquired by the museum in 1974. <br><br>

Native people from many tribal nations have long come to Manhattan as visitors and workers, artists and diplomats. Many of the city’s skyscrapers were constructed with the assistance of Mohawk steel workers looking down on a city that hardly knew they were there. The 1990 census shows 27,531 Native Americans in New York City. The American Indian Community House, founded in 1969, is a cultural and social support center strengthening Manhattan as a place of native homecoming.<br><br>
The Europeans who came here recognized the island as an ideal trade center, seeking to own the land Delaware people saw as their mother. Dutch, French and English all competed for Manhattan Island. From 1626 to 1664, the Dutch colonized it and called it New Netherlands. Although no deed exists, Peter Minuit, first governor of New Netherlands, reportedly &#8220;purchased&#8221; the island from native people called &#8220;Manhattans&#8221; (ironically, probably the Canarsie people from Brooklyn) for sixty guilders worth of trading goods in 1626. The English finally won possession of Manhattan from the Dutch in 1664, but Native people lost the most. battles with Europeans for land and against diseases they brought killed vast numbers of Indian people.<br><br>
Yet American Indians never vanished from Manhattan. Although not as visible as in the seventeenth century, Indian people continue to survive and contribute to the city’s cultural landscape.]]></desc>

Through the decades, many buildings have graced this important corner of the Manhattan grid. One of the earliest buildings with architectural distinction was the Booth Theatre of the Civil War era. Adorning the exterior was a medallion-relief of Shakespeare that greeted theatergoers of the period as they attended the popular Shakespearean productions by Edwin Booth<br><br>
Retaining the medallion of Shakespeare, the McCreery Department Store replaced the theater in 1878 with an elevation composition characteristic of the other Mercantile Palaces and Dry Goods Emporiums that are still prominent on Sixth Avenue.<br><br>
On November 18, 1997 the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved this exterior building design by Richard Cook & Associates, Architects that reiterates the historic façade rhythms with traditional materials. In conjunction, reinterpretations of elements of the district such as open metal cornices and contemporary detailed mercantile shop bays results in a façade deferential to the context yet still distinctly modern in appearance. Integrally marked into this façade, above the corner of the Ladies Mile Historic District; once again is Shakespeare set.]]></desc>

While regarded by some as a notable example of Egyptian Revival architecture, Charles Dickens quipped in his American Notes of 1842: &#8220;What is this dismal fronted pile of bastard Egyptian, like an enchanter’s palace in a melodrama?&#8221; Built to accommodate 300 prisoners, it occupied a full block in Lower Manhattan, surrounded by Centre, Franklin, Elm (today’s Lafayette), and Leonard Streets.<br><br>
The block on which the building stood had been created in 1811 by the filling-in of a small lake &#8211; an important fresh water source for colonial New York. By 1800, industrialization and population density resulted in the severe pollution of the pond, and it was condemned, drained and filled in. Over this swampy, foul-smelling area was concentrated housing for some of New York&#8221;s (sic) poorest citizens by the time of the prison’s construction in 1838. The building’s enormous, heavy masonry was built atop giant caissons of lashed hemlock trunks sunk in a bid for stability, however the entire structure declined entropically soon after it was opened. This watery foundation,(sic) along with the tomblike solidity of this building, especially for African American detainees who were housed on the lowest, dampest levels, led to it’s (sic) reputation as an egregious, unsanitary hellhole for decades to come.<br><br>
The prison was well known for its corruption and went through numerous scandals and successful prison escapes throughout its early history and, by 1850, many were calling for its destruction, leading to the Haviland building being replaced by a new structure in 1902,(sic) that was connected by a &#8220;Bridge of Sighs&#8221; with the Criminal Courts on Franklin Street. In 1941, that building was duly replaced by one at 125 White Street, officially named the Manhattan House of Detention, though still popularly referred to as &#8220;The Tombs&#8221;.<br><br>
Part of &#8220;The Tombs&#8221; was eventually closed in 1974 due to security and health reasons, and shortly thereafter, the structure was pulled down and replaced with a fourth building &#8211; the current facility, which again comprises two connected buildings &#8211; a 381 capacity tower that is the remaining part of the 1941 building (at 100 Centre Street) and 500 capacity tower north of it, opened in 1990.<br><br>
The current Tombs Prison was named the Bernard B. Kerik Complex in December 2001 at the direction of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In 2006, Kerik was disgraced by the unearthing of numerous ethics violations dating from his tenure as a city employee, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg subsequently ordered his name removed. The current Manhattan Detention Complex &#8211;(sic) has a capacity of 898 undergoing the intake process or facing trial in Manhattan &#8211; a vital link in the nations (sic) criminal justice conveyor belt that boasts the world (sic) largest prison population, both in size and as a percentage of the population, with over two million citizens behind persons behind bars (sic), a six-fold increase since 1972]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
On October 11, 1869, with the blessing of their religious leaders and a gift of $5.00, two Sisters of Charity, Sr. Mary Irene Fitzgibbon and Sr. Teresa Vincent McCrystal, opened one of the first foundling asylums in the United States on East 12th Street. The Foundling was the Sisters’ answer to the thousands of orphaned and abandoned infants left on the streets of New York City.<br><br>
The courage of the enterprise caught the conscience of civic leaders and responsible citizenry and the Foundling soon became a beacon of hope to unwed mothers with infants and to pregnant homeless girls. Despite untold struggles, the work flourished. Thousands of mothers and children found support. Thousands of other abandoned children found life through their early care, though their adoptions and placements across the United states, contributing vitality and growth to the nation.<br><br>
As the Foundling celebrates its 125th anniversary in its fifth home, misery abides with only a change of face. Encouraged by a vibrant tradition, the Foundling continues to respond to the needs of families and communities who contend with the violence, disease, drugs and homelessness of this era. In 1994, Sister Irene’s vision and courage extend annually to 10,000 children, youth and adults who are serviced by 44 different health, education and social service programs.<br><br>

<b>Museum of American Finance</b><br>
What more appropriate home for the Museum of American Finance than the grand, 30-foot-high banking hall of the former Bank of New York building? The museum &#8211; an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution &#8211; is the only one of its kind in America. Effectively serving as the New York Stock Exchange’s <i>de facto</i> visitors’ center, the museum displays permanent interactive exhibits on finance, money, entrepreneurship and banking. These feature rare examples of Colonial currency, stock and bond certificates dating from the 18th century to the present; high denomination currency including $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills; and hundreds of images of the financial district. The museum includes a room dedicated to Hamilton, founder of the bank and the country’s first Treasury Secretary.<br>
<br>
<b>48 Wall Street</b><br>
The Bank of New York &#8211; oldest bank in the city, founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton &#8211; commissioned a new headquarters (their third on this site) in 1927. The Bank instructed architect Benjamin Wistar Morris to incorporate something of the institution’s Colonial history in the design. That history is evident inside the main banking hall, where eight murals by J. Monroe Hewlett illustrate the story of American commerce and the life of the Bank. Outside, the building’s major Colonial reference is meant to be seen from a distance: a tower reminiscent of an 18th-century church, but thirty stories up in the air &#8211; definitely the only Colonial tower in the Downtown skyline.<br>
<br>
<i>( 40 Wall Street Side )</i><br>
<b>The Bank of the Manhattan Company</b><br>
This 20th-century skyscraper has roots in late-18th-century New York, and the historic rivalry between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Burr, in 1799, helped found the Manhattan Company, chartered to bring the city safe drinking water. Hamilton in 1784 had organized the Bank of New York, the city’s only such institution, and frowned on the notion of creating a rival. Being a State assemblyman, however, Burr finagled permission from the Legislature for the newly formed Manhattan Company to devote any capital it might raise beyond two million dollars to a different kind of liquidity, thereby becoming the city’s second bank. Eventually, the Bank of Manhattan &#8211; having long since abandoned the water business &#8211; merged with the Chase National Bank to create Chase Manhattan, a titan on New York’s financial scene.<br>
<br>
<b>Skyscraper Rivals</b><br>
During the 1920s, the Bank of Manhattan engaged in another famous rivalry &#8211; for the title of World’s Tallest Building. In 1929, the contest narrowed to just two contenders, pitting Downtown against Midtown: the Bank of Manhattan at 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building on 42nd Street, respectively &#8211; whose architects, moreover, were former partners. The Bank appeared to be winning when its rooftop flagpole topped Chrysler’s most recently announced height of 925 feet by two feet more. Then Chrysler, in the middle of the night, secretly hoisted through the roof a five-part spire, raising the tower’s height to 1,046 feet and winning the final round of the competition. And that was that &#8211; until, of course, the Empire State Building opened 18 months later.]]></desc>

Built in 1861, this building is significant as the only remaining cast-iron building façade in the city attributable to James Bogardus, the self-described &#8220;inventor of the cast-iron building&#8221;. Typically, the cast-iron façade was made in the style of a 15th century Italian palazzo and attached to a support structure immediately behind it. It was built as a dry goods storehouse for Kitchen, Montross and Wilcox. Buildings of this type flourished in this section of the city from the mid-1850s to the 1880s.<br><br>

    <cmt><![CDATA[Near East 26th Street, New York, (On the right when traveling east)]]></cmt>
    <desc><![CDATA[<br>
The Admiral David Glasgow Farragut Monument was installed and dedicated in Madison Square Park in 1881. During the Civil War, Admiral Farragut commanded the Union naval fleet in its defeat of Confederate forces at the 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay, Alabama. While the admiral’s famous order &#8220;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&#8221; may have been apocryphal, the subject of myth-making, it has nonetheless endured to exemplify his courage.<br><br>

The Farragut Monument&#8212;one of New York City’s most acclaimed historic public works&#8212;was the collaboration of the Irish-born American Renaissance sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907), who made the bronze statue of the admiral, and Beaux-Arts architect Stanford White (1853-1906), who collaborated on the pedestal in the form of a high-backed bluestone bench In its day the statue was distinguished by the admiral’s naturalistic presence, an innovation in an era when figurative sculpture was often formal and academic. Farragut appears to stand on a ship’s prow, the ocean gales blowing open the coat of his naval uniform, binoculars poised in one hand and a sword hanging at his side.<br><br>

The base with undulating lines suggesting the high seas includes bas-reliefs of two female figures, Loyalty and Courage. While Farragut is clothed and identified, the female symbols are unnamed, draped attributes in service to characteristics of his military prowess. Inscribed across one side of the monument’s base are significant dates in the admiral’s life. The bluestone bench deteriorated and was replaced in 1935 with a granite copy made by Public Works Administration artists. The original is preserved at the Saint-Gaudens National Historic park, the site of the artist’s summer home in Cornish, New Hampshire.<br><br>

Farragut (1801-1870) was born in Tennessee. His mother, Elizabeth Shine (d. 1808), immigrated from Scotland to North Carolina. His father, John Farragut Mesquide (1755-1817), was a merchant captain from the island of Menorca who immigrated to America in 1776 and served in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. On his wife’s death, the elder Farragut placed his five children with separate families. Historians describe how young Farragut joined the Navy in 1810, when he was just nine years old, and served in the War of 1812; be became the adopted son of David Porter of the U.S. Navy, a family friend.<br><br>

Farragut’s first wife was Susan Caroline Marchant (1805-1840). After her death, he married Virginia Dorcas Loyall (1824-1884). Their son, Loyall (1844-1916), was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly before the Civil War, when the Commonwealth of Virginia announced that it would secede, the family moved to New York to side with the Union. Historians call Farragut a &#8220;Southern Unionist,&#8221; a description that has implicit contradictions. Notable biographies of Farragut were published in 1892, 1941-1943, and s00s, and a 1997 book documents his Civil War campaigns. These volumes highlight Farragut’s operational tactics rather than extensive discussion of the central issue of the Civil War; slavery. While his biographers have addressed neither Farragut’s opinions on nor his practice related to slavery, 1840 and 1850 census records from Norfolk, Virginia, respectively, indicate that Farragut and his wife’s family held enslaved Africans. The documents list the gender and age of these individuals but do not includes their names. While his position as a slaveholder will guide ongoing review of his place in history, Farragut’s efforts to overwhelm Confederate forces&#8212;which would ultimately achieve the abolition of slavery&#8212;many now be considered only one part of his legacy.<br><br>

Architect Goldwin Starrett designed the Algonquin's main twelve-story structure in brick with limestone, metal, and terra-cotta elements. The Beaux-Arts inspired building was designed with projecting metal bay windows and classical details. In 1905, the three-story annex of brick, metal, and glazed wood was converted from a nineteenth century stable to a cafe and dining room for the hotel.]]></desc>

This building is the bank's third constructed on the 48 Wall Street site. The elegantly detailed limestone structure was constructed when the banking industry led in the redevelopment of downtown Manhattan with impressive 
skyscrapers. The setback tower culminated in a federal-style cupola crowned by an American eagle and contributes a striking element to the skyline of lower Manhattan.

The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory occupied the building's top three floors. In 1909, Triangle employees initiated the first large-scale strike of women workers in the country, but workers demands for increased fire safety were not met. On March 25, 1911, a fire swept through the factory, claiming the lives of 146 garment workers. Prompted by the outrage of reformers and labor unions, notably the ILGWU, New York State enacted legislation to safeguard the health and safety of workers. These laws subsequently served as models for national labor and safety reforms. The building facade was largely undamaged by the fire. In 1929 Frederick Brown donated the building to New York University, which named it in his honor, and has used it ever since as an academic building.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br><b>Bowling Green</b><br><br>This little patch of green surrounded by grand Broadway office buildings survives as New York City’s oldest public park &#8211; Bowling Green. It served as a cattle pasture and a parade ground before being designated in 1733 as a bowling green by the City’s Common Council, for the &#8220;Beauty & ornament of Broadway as well as for the Recreation & Delight of the Inhabitants of this City.&#8221; Bowling Green remains one of the few spots in Downtown that would be recognized today by the Dutch settlers of the West India Company who founded the trading post of Nieuw Amsterdam here in the 1620s.<br><br>In 1770, the British chose Bowling Green as the site for a gilded, equestrian statue of King George II &#8211; followed in 1771 by a fence meant to protect it from hostile colonists. The statue was pulled down on July 9, 1776 by a revolutionary crowd, after the Declaration of Independence was first read in New York, but much of the fence survives, a rare remnant from Colonial times here on the site of the city’s Dutch origins.<br><br><b>Sports Museum of America</b><br><br>Football, baseball, basketball, soccer &#8211; what unites Americans more than our love of sports? Over two dozen of the city’s ticker-tape parades &#8211; all passing right by 26 Broadway &#8211; have honored athletes, including Olympic teams, tennis champions and World Series winners. What better location for America’s first and only museum celebrating every American sport?<br><br>As sports means action, this is no ordinary museum. Even rare artifacts cannot fully convey the thrill of a grand slam or a slam dunk &#8211; so interactive exhibits put visitors inside the game and on the field. Be a hockey goalie watching an incoming 100-mph slapshot, or a NASCAR driver screaming around a racetrack. It’s all about reliving those glorious goose-bump moments.<br><br>Among its many attractions, the Museum houses the Billie Jean King International Women’s Sports Center, the world’s first hall of fame for female athletes, and the original Heisman Trophy.<br><br><b>Canyon of Heroes</b><br><br>Since 1886, with festivities marking the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, Broadway has seen some 200 ticker-tape parades &#8211; grand processions of honorees and dignitaries marching north from Bowling Green up to City Hall Park, to the cheers of thousands of New Yorkers lining the sidewalks. The parades have celebrated everyone from presidents, generals and royalty to aviators, veterans, and athletes. That history is now written in stone &#8211; literally &#8211; thanks to commemorative plaques installed in the Broadway sidewalks. Each plaque identifies the date of the parade and the name of the honoree, spelling out the history that has transformed Broadway into the &#8220;Canyon of Heroes.&#8221; You can obtain a history of the parades from the Alliance for Downtown New York, by calling 212.566.6700.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[<br>This small square marks the grave of General William Jenkins Worth (1794-1849). Born to Quaker parents in Hudson, New York, Worth worked briefly at a store in Hudson before moving to Albany to pursue a mercantile career. With the outbreak of the War of 1812 (1812-1815), he broke with his family’s pacifist beliefs and enlisted in the Army. He distinguished himself as an aide-de-camp to Generals Morgan Lewis and Winfield &#8220;Old Fuss and Feathers&#8221; Scott. Worth was promoted for battlefield valor at Chippewa (July 5, 1814) and Lundy’s Lane (July 25, 1814) near Niagara Falls. Although he was not a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, he served as its fourth Commandant of Cadets from 1820 to 1828. Returning to battlefield service in 1841, Worth fought in the last stages of the Second Seminole War and was promoted to the rank of general in 1842. Though a victorious commander in Florida, Worth urged that the Seminoles be allowed to live in peace and maintain certain territorial rights.<br><br>After a short stint fighting on the Texas frontier, Worth was transferred back under General Scott’s command for the Mexican War (1846-1848). He commanded a division at the siege of Vera Cruz (March 9-29, 1847), the battles of Cerro Gordo (April 18), Contreras and Churubusco (August 19-20), and Molino del Rey (September 8). He also participated in the seizure of the San Cosme Gate during the American army’s final assault on Mexico City (September 13-14). A lengthy dispute involving charges of intrigue against General Scott ended in his successful acquittal by a court of inquiry in 1848, and Worth was reappointed to command post of the Department of Texas. He died of cholera in San Antonio the following year, and his body was returned to the state of his birth for burial.<br><br>The City originally leased this site at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue, West 24th and West 25th Street in the Flatiron district of Manhattan to the United States Government for $1.00 as part of an 1807 land deal. It reverted to city ownership in 1824. Parks designated it as a public park in 1847. Worth had been temporarily interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn while the site was chosen and developed for his permanent interment. He was reburied here on Evacuation Day, November 25, 1857, the anniversary of the British departure from the American colonies. The burial followed an elaborate processional which included 6,500 soldiers. A relic box was placed in the cornerstone. Mayor Fernando Wood delivered the principal oration.<br><br>James Goodwin Batterson (1823-1901) designed the 51-foot granite Wood Monument. He was the founder of Travelers Insurance Company and one of the designers of the United States Capitol and Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., as well as the New York State Capitol in Albany. The monument’s central decorative bands are inscribed with battle sites significant in Worth’s career and attached to its front is a bronze equestrian relief of Worth. The four corner granite piers once held decorative lampposts, but they now support an elaborate ornamental cast-iron fence whose pickets are replicas of Worth’s Congressional Sword of Honor. The north side fence was removed around 1940 to accommodate an above ground utility shed which services the water supply system pipes beneath the monument.<br><br>In 1994, Municipal Art Society President Kent Barwick, Preservationist Henry Hope Reed, and Parks Commissioner Henry Stern commemorated the 200th anniversary of Worth’s birth and laid a wreath at the site. In 1995, the monument underwent an extensive restoration funded mainly by the Paul & Klara Porzelt Foundation and Commander, United States Navy (Retired) James A. Woodruff Jr, Worth’s great-great grandson. He and his family have endowed the maintenance of the monument and surrounding planting bed through the Municipal Art Society’s Adopt-A-Monument Program.<br><br>The Worth Monument is the second oldest monument in New York &#8211; the oldest being the 1856 George Washington equestrian monument at the southern end of Union Square. It also remains one of only two New York monuments that also serves as a mausoleum. The other is Grant’s Tomb in Harlem.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[This sandstone fort was built in 1811 as one of five forts erected to defend New York Harbor. The fort originally stood on a small island that was linked to Manhattan by a 200-foot wooden causeway and drawbridge. In the 1850s, landfill extended Battery Park to this point.<br><br>

The D-shaped fort held 28 cannons, but never saw military action. In 1823 the U.S. Army gave Castle Clinton to New York City, which used the structure in many ways over the next century.<br><br>

After is designation as a National Monument in 1946, Castle Clinton was restored to its original appearance as a stone fort, and now serves as a National Park Service visitor center.<br><br>

Last of a series of forts which, from the Dutch ssettlement of 1624, guarded lower Manhattan, this structure was built by the United States in the years 1808 to 1811. It was first called "West Battery," and was one of the important defenses of New York Harbor during the War of 1812 period. Named in honor of Gov. DeWitt Clinton in 1815, in that year it was made headquarters, U.S. Third Military District. From 1816 to 1820 Gen. Winfield Scott was in command. The Headquarters was removed from Castle Clinton to Governors Island in 1820.<br><br>

<i>[Right plaque]:</i><br>
Ceded to New York City in 1823, Castle Clinton was renamed Castled Garden in 1824. Until 1855 it served as a public center and theater where public figures, including lafayette, Kossuth, and President Jackson, were received, and artists such as Jenny Lind were presented. From 1855 to 1890, the structure was the nation's principal immigrant depot, with over 7 million immigrants entering its portals - the "Gateway to the New World." Between 1896 and 1941 the old structure served as the New York City Acquarium. It was created a national monument in 1950.]]></desc>
